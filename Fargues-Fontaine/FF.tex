\section{Newton Polygons and Factorizations}
\subsection{The Power Series Case}
\lecture[Newton polygons of polynomials. The Legendre Transform. Newton polygons of power series. Newton polygons in $\IA_\inf$ and untilts of $\Oo_F$.]{2019-11-13}
Let $K$ be a non-archimedean field, $v\colon K\morphism\IR\cup\{\infty\}$ its valuation (written additively). Let $f=a_0+a_1T+\dotsb+a_nT^n\in K[T]$ be a polynomial.
\begin{defi}
	The \defemph{Newton polygon} $\Newt_\poly(f)$ is the largest convex polygon below $\{(i,v(a_i))\}_{i\in\IZ}$, where we put $a_i=0$ for $i\notin\{0,1,\dotsc,n\}$ by convention.
\end{defi}
There is a better description via the \defemph{Legendre transform}. To set this up, we introduce the notations $\ov{\IR}=\IR\cup\{\pm\infty\}$ and $\Ff=\{\phi\colon \ov{\IR}\morphism\ov{\IR}\}$.
\begin{defi}
	We define the \defemph{Legendre transform} $\Ll\colon \Ff\morphism\Ff$ and the \defemph{inverse Legendre transform} $\snake{\Ll}\colon \Ff\morphism\Ff$ via
	\begin{align*}
		\Ll\phi(\lambda)&=\inff_{x\in\IR}\{\phi(x)+\lambda x\}\,\\
		\snake{\Ll}\phi(x)&=\sup_{x\in\IR}\{\phi(\lambda)-\lambda x\}\,.
	\end{align*}
\end{defi}
Note that $\snake{\Ll}\phi=-\Ll(-\phi)$. As a Slogan: \enquote{$\Ll$ and $\snake{\Ll}$ interchange $x$-coordinates and slopes}.
\begin{exm}\label{exm:LegendreOfLinear}
	If $\phi(x)=ax+b$, then one easily verifies
	\begin{equation*}
		\Ll\phi(\lambda)=\begin{cases}
			b & \text{if }\lambda=-a\\
			-\infty & \text{else}
		\end{cases}\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Also note that $\snake{\Ll}\Ll\phi=\phi$ in this case.
\end{exm}
\begin{lem}\label{lem:Legendre}
	Let $\phi,\psi\in\Ff$. Then the following hold.
	\begin{numerate}
		\item The Legendre transform $\Ll\phi$ is always concave, i.e., it satisfies the inequality
		\begin{equation*}
			\Ll\phi(a\lambda+b\mu)\geq a\Ll\phi(\lambda)+b\Ll\phi(\mu)
		\end{equation*}
		for all $a,b\geq 0$ such that $a+b=1$. Similarly $\snake{\Ll}\phi$ is convex.
		\item If $\phi\leq \psi$, then $\Ll\phi\leq \Ll\psi$ and $\snake{\Ll}\phi\leq \snake{\Ll}\psi$.
		\item We have $\snake{\Ll}\Ll\phi\leq \phi\leq \Ll\snake{\Ll}\phi$.
		\item If $\phi$ admits a supporting line at $x$ of slope $\lambda$, i.e., $\phi(y)\geq \phi(x)+\lambda(y-x)$ for all $y$, then $\Ll\phi$ admits a capping line at $-\lambda$ of slope $x$.
		\item $\snake{\Ll}\Ll\phi$ is the largest convex function below $\phi$, and likewise $\Ll\snake{\Ll}\phi$ is the smallest concave function over $\phi$.
		\item $\Ll$ and $\snake{\Ll}$ define inverse bijections $\{\text{convex }\phi\colon \IR\morphism\ov{\IR}\}\lrisomorphism \{\text{concave }\psi\colon \IR\morphism\ov{\IR}\}$.
	\end{numerate}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
	Parts \itememph{1} to \itememph{4} are straightforward from the definitions. We only prove \itememph{5} and \itememph{6}. For $a,b\in \IR$ put $\psi_{a,b}(x)=ax+b$ and consider the set $M\coloneqq\left\{(a,b)\st \psi_{a,b}\leq \phi\right\}$. Then $\psi=\sup_M\left\{\psi_{a,b}\right\}$ is the largest convex function below $\phi$. By \itememph{1} and \itememph{3} we get $\snake{\Ll}\Ll\phi\leq \psi$. Moreover, \cref{exm:LegendreOfLinear} and \itememph{2} show 
	\begin{equation*}
		\psi_{a,b}=\snake{\Ll}\Ll\psi_{a,b}\leq \snake{\Ll}\Ll\phi\,,
	\end{equation*}
	hence $\psi\leq \snake{\Ll}\Ll\phi$. This proves that $\snake{\Ll}\Ll\phi$ is the largest convex function below $\phi$. The second part of \itememph{5} is completely analogous.
	
	Part~\itememph{6} is a formal consequence of \itememph{3} and \itememph{5}. We know that $\Ll\colon(\Ff,\leq)\doublelrmorphism (\Ff,\leq)\noloc \snake{\Ll}$ define an adjoint pair of functors. Hence $\Ll$ and $\snake{\Ll}$ induce inverse bijections between the full subcategories on which the unit resp.\ the counit of this adjunction is a natural isomorphism. Now $\left\{\phi\st \snake{\Ll}\Ll\phi=\phi\right\}=\{\phi\text{ convex}\}$ and likewise $\left\{\psi\st \psi=\Ll\snake{\Ll}\psi\right\}=\{\psi\text{ concave}\}$.
\end{proof}
\numpar{Example \smash{\Attention}}
$\Ll$ and $\snake{\Ll}$ preserve piece-wise linear functions. In pictures, this looks roughly as follows.

Back to Newton polynoms for polygonials. Let $f\in K[T]$ be as above. As $\Newt_\poly(f)$ is the largest convex function below $\{(i,v(a_i))\}_{i\in \IZ}$, we have
\begin{equation*}
	\Ll\Newt_\poly(f)(r)=\inff_{i\in\IZ}\left\{v(a_i)+ri\right\}\eqqcolon v_r(f)\,.
\end{equation*}
The expression on the right-hand side has a nice geometric interpretation for $r\in v(\ov{K})$. In this case we have
\begin{equation*}
	v_r(f)\coloneqq \inff_{i\in\IZ}\left\{v(a_i)+ri\right\}=\inff\left\{v(f(x))\st x\in\ov{K}\text{ and }v(x)=r\right\}\,.
\end{equation*}
Indeed, as $v(a_ix^i)=v(a_i)+ri$, it's clear that \enquote{$\geq $} holds. For the converse, choose $x_0\in\ov{K}$ with $v(x_0)=r$. We want to find a $y\in\ov{K}$ such that $v(y)=0$ and $v(f(x_0y))=v_r(f)$. Let $b\in \ov{K}$ such that $v(b)=-v_r(f)$ and put $b_i=ba_ix_0^i$. Then $v(b_i)\geq 0$. Let $n_0\leq n$ be the largest index such that $v(b_{n_0})=0$. Let $c\in\ov{K}$ such that $v(c)=0=v(b_0-c)$, which exists as $\Oo_{\ov{K}}/\mm_{\ov{K}}$ is an algebraically closed field, hence has at least two non-zero elements. Now let $y\in\ov{K}$ be a solution of $c=b_0+\dotsb+b_{n_0}y^{n_0}$. As $v(b_{n_0})=0$, $y\in\Oo_{\ov{K}}$, and then a simple inspection shows $v(y)=0$. Now it's easy to check that indeed $v(f(x_0y))=v_r(f)$, hence we are done. 
\begin{exc}\label{exc:vrOfProduct}
	For all polynomials $f,g\in K[T]$ and all $r\in\IR$ we have 
	\begin{equation*}
		v_r(fg)=v_r(f)+v_r(g)\,.
	\end{equation*}
\end{exc}
\begin{proof*}
	Let $(a_i)$ and $(b_j)$ be the coefficients of $f$ and $g$, and $(c_k)$ the coefficients of $fg$. Then $c_k=\sum_{i+j=k}a_ib_j$. Hence $v(c_k)+rk\geq \inf\{v(a_i)+ri+v(b_j)+rj\}$ by the strong triangle inequality. This shows \enquote{$\geq$}. 
	
	For the converse, let $s\geq 0$ and $t\geq 0$ be minimal indices such that $v(a_s)+rs=v_r(f)$ and $v(b_t)+rt=v_r(g)$. For all $(i,j)\neq (s,t)$ satisfying $i+j=s+t$, we have 
	\begin{equation*}
		v(a_i)+ri+v(b_j)+rj>v(a_s)+rs+v(b_t)+rt\,,
	\end{equation*}
	hence $v(a_i)+v(b_j)>v(a_s)+v(b_t)$, hence $v(c_{s+t})=v(a_s)+v(b_t)$. This finally proves $v(c_{s+t})+r(s+t)=v_r(f)+v_r(g)$ and we are done.
\end{proof*}
\begin{rem}\label{rem:Ladditive}
	For $f=a_0+a_1T+\dotsb+a_nT^n$ let $\phi_f$ be the piece-wise linear function connecting the $\{(i,v(a_i))\}_{i\in\IZ}$. Then \cref{exc:vrOfProduct} shows $\Ll\phi_{fg}=\Ll\phi_f+\Ll\phi_g$. As a slogan, we \enquote{concatenate the concave piece-wise linear functions to a new one}.
\end{rem}
\begin{defi}
	Let $\phi,\psi\in\Ff$ such that $-\infty\notin \im\phi\cup\im\psi$. Then we define the \defemph{convolution} $\phi*\psi\colon \IR\morphism\ov{\IR}$ as
	\begin{equation*}
		(\phi*\psi)(x)=\inff_{y+z=x}\left\{\phi(y)+\psi(z)\right\}\,.
	\end{equation*}
\end{defi}
\begin{lem}\label{lem:convolution}
	Let $\phi,\psi\in\Ff$ such that $-\infty\notin \im\phi\cup\im\psi$.
	\begin{numerate}
		\item If $\phi$ and $\psi$ are convex, then so is $\phi*\psi$.
		\item We have $\Ll(\phi*\psi)=\Ll\phi+\Ll\psi$.
	\end{numerate}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof*}
	We start with \itememph{1}. Let $x_1,x_2\in\IR$ and $a,b\geq 0$ such that $a+b=1$. We need to show
	\begin{equation*}
		(\phi*\psi)(ax_1+bx_2)\leq a(\phi*\psi)(x_1)+b(\phi*\psi)(x_2)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Let $y_1,y_2,z_1,z_2\in\IR$ such that $x_1=y_1+z_1$ and $x_2=y_2+z_2$. Put $x=ax_1+bx_2$, $y=ay_1+bz_1$, and $z=ay_2+by_2$. Then $x=y+z$ and 
	\begin{equation*}
		\phi(y)+\psi(z)\leq a(\phi(y_1)+\psi(y_2))+b(\phi(z_1)+\psi(z_2))
	\end{equation*}
	by convexity of $\phi$ and $\psi$. Taking infima shows the required inequality. This shows \itememph{1}. Part~\itememph{2} follows straight from the definitions.
\end{proof*}
\begin{cor}\label{cor:NewtConvolution}
	If $f,g\in K[T]$ are polynomials, then
	\begin{equation*}
		\Newt_\poly(fg)=\Newt_\poly(f)*\Newt_\poly(g)\,.
	\end{equation*}
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
	Both sides are convex by definition, and agree after applying $\Ll$ (use \cref{rem:Ladditive} and \cref{lem:convolution}), so they are already equal by \cref{lem:Legendre}.
\end{proof}
\begin{exm}\label{exm:NewtConvolution}
	Let's illustrate \cref{cor:NewtConvolution} for $f=T-\alpha$ and $g=T-\beta$:
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzpicture}[line width=rule_thickness, line cap=round, line join =round, x=1cm,y=1cm]
		\begin{scope}[xshift=-9.5cm]
		\draw[-to] (-0.5,0) -- (2.5,0);
		\draw[-to] (0,-0.5) -- (0,2.5);
		\fill (0,1) circle (0.5ex);
		\fill (0.5,0) circle (0.5ex);
		\draw[thick] (0,1) -- (0.5,0) node[pos=0.5,above right=-2] {$-v(\alpha)$};
		\node at (1.25,2) {$\Newt_\poly(f)$};
		\end{scope}
		\begin{scope}[xshift=-5.5cm]
		\draw[-to] (-0.5,0) -- (2.5,0);
		\draw[-to] (0,-0.5) -- (0,2.5);
		\fill (0,0.4) circle (0.5ex);
		\fill (1.25,0) circle (0.5ex);
		\draw[thick] (0,0.4) -- (1.25,0);
		\node[above] at (0.75,0.25) {$-v(\beta)$};
		\node at (1.25,2) {$\Newt_\poly(g)$};
		\end{scope}
		\begin{scope}[xshift=0cm]
		\draw[-to] (-0.5,0) -- (2.5,0);
		\draw[-to] (0,-0.5) -- (0,2.5);
		\fill (0,1.4) circle (0.5ex);

		\fill (1.75,0) circle (0.5ex);
		\draw[thick] (0,1.4) -- (0.5,0.4) node[pos=0.5,above right=-2] {$-v(\alpha)$} -- (1.75,0);
		\node[above] at (1.25,0.25) {$-v(\beta)$};
		\node at (1.25,2) {$\Newt_\poly(fg)$};
		\end{scope}
		\draw[-to,bend left] (-2.5,1) to node[pos=0.5,above=1] {convolution} (-1,1);
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}
	In particular, if $f\in K[T]$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ and $\alpha_1,\dotsc,\alpha_n\in\ov{K}$ its zeros counted with multiplicity, then induction on $n$ shows that $\Newt_\poly(f)$ has exactly $-v(\alpha_1),\dotsc,-v(\alpha_n)$ as its slopes, with the same multiplicities.
\end{exm}
Now we want to define Newton polygons for power series. So let $f\in \Oo_K\llbracket T\rrbracket$ be a power series, say, $f=\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_iT^i$.
\begin{defi}
	The \defemph{Newton polygon} $\Newt(f)$ is the largest \defemph{decreasing} convex function below $\{(i,v(a_i))\}_{i\in\IZ}$, where $a_i=0$ for $i<0$ by convention. In other words,
	\begin{equation*}
		\Ll\Newt(f)(r)=\begin{cases}
		v_r(f)\coloneqq\inff_{i\in\IZ}\{v(a_i)+ri\} & \text{if }r\geq 0\\
		-\infty & \text{if }r<0
		\end{cases}\,.
	\end{equation*}
\end{defi}
\begin{rem}
	\begin{numerate}
		\item A power series $f$ defines a function on the \enquote{open rigid-analytic unit disc} $\ID=\left\{x\st |x|<1\right\}$. In fact, one can handle general $f\in K\llbracket T\rrbracket$ as functions if one is careful with domains of convergence.
		\item For $f\in\Oo_K[T]$, $\Newt(f)$ omits the positive slopes from $\Newt_\poly(f)$, as these correspond to zeros outside of $\ID$. In particular, $\Newt(f)\neq \Newt_\poly(f)$ in general.
	\end{numerate}
\end{rem}
Similar to the polynomial case in \cref{exm:NewtConvolution}, there is a connection between slopes of the Newton polygon of a power series $f$ and zeros of $f$ (but we won't prove this). 
\begin{thm}[Lazard]\label{thm:Lazard}
	Let $f\in\Oo_K\llbracket T\rrbracket$. Let $\lambda\neq 0$ be a slope of $\Newt(f)$. Then there exists a zero $\alpha\in\roof{\ov{K}}$ of $f$ with $v(\alpha)=-\lambda$. In other words, in $\Oo_{\roof{\ov{K}}}\llbracket T\rrbracket$ the power series $f$ an be factored as $f=(T-\alpha)g$.
\end{thm}
\begin{rem}
	\begin{numerate}
		\item Suppose $\Newt(f)$ is eventually constant (this is e.g.\ the case if $K$ is discretely valued), i.e., $f=a\snake{f}$ for $a\in\Oo_K$ and $\snake{f}$ is primitive of some degree $d$. Then the Weierstraß preparation theorem shows $f=aPg$, where $a\in \Oo_K$, $P$ is a monic polynomial of degree $d$, and $g\in\Oo_K\llbracket T\rrbracket^\times$ is a unit.
		\item Suppose $\cha K=0$. Then $\log_p(1-x)=\sum_{i=0}^\infty (-1)^{i-1}x^i/i$ has zeros precisely at $\mu_{p^\infty}(\ov{K})$. Draw the Newton polygon of $\log_p(1-x)$ and prove this!
	\end{numerate}
\end{rem}
\subsection{Newton Polygons in \texorpdfstring{$\IA_\inf$}{Ainf}}
With notation as usual we put $\IA_\inf=W_{\Oo_E}(\Oo_F)$. We want to introduce an analogue of Newton polygons of power series for $\IA_\inf$. As a side note, there is no \enquote{subring of polynomials in $\IA_\inf$}: $\left\{\sum_{i=0}^n[a_i]\pi^i\st a_i\in\Oo_F\right\}$ is not closed under addition. So there's no sensible generalization of Newton polygons of polynomials to $\IA_\inf$.
\begin{defi}\label{def:AinfNewton}
	Let $f=\sum_{i=0}^\infty[a_i]\pi^i\in\IA_\inf$. Then the \defemph{Newton polygon $\Newt(f)$ of $f$} is the largest decreasing convex function below $\{(i,v(a_i))\}_{i\in\IZ}$. In other words,
	\begin{equation*}
		\Ll\Newt(f)(r)=\begin{cases}
		v_r(f)\coloneqq\inff_{i\in\IZ}\{v(a_i)+ri\} & \text{if }r\geq 0\\
		-\infty & \text{if }r<0
		\end{cases}\,.
	\end{equation*}
\end{defi}
\numpar{Lemma \smash{\Attention}}\label{lem:vrValuation}\itshape
For all $r\geq 0$, $v_r\colon \IA_\inf\morphism\IR\cup\{\infty\}$ is a valuation. In particular, for $f,g\in\IA_\inf$ we have
\begin{equation*}
	\Newt(fg)=\Newt(f)*\Newt(g)\,.
\end{equation*}\upshape
\begin{proof*}
	It's clear that $v_r(f)=\infty$ iff $f=0$. We first establish the strong triangle inequality. This is essentially straightforward, but still technical. Define \enquote{twisted Witt polynomials}
	\begin{equation*}
		\snake{S}_n(X_0,\dotsc,X_n,Y_0,\dotsc,Y_n)=S_n\left(X_0^{q^0},\dotsc,X_n^{q^n},Y_0^{q^0},\dotsc,Y_n^{q^n}\right)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Using the inductive construction of the $S_n$, it's easy to check that $\snake{S}_n$ is homogeneous of degree $q^n$. If $\alpha X_0^{s_0}\dotsm X_n^{s_n}Y_0^{t_0}\dotsm Y_n^{t_n}$ is a monomial of total degree $q^n$, we define its \defemph{weight} as $q^{-n}\sum_{i=0}^ni(s_i+t_i)$. We claim:
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item[\itememph{*}] There is a polynomial $T_n$ such that $\snake{S}_n\equiv T_n\mod \pi$, no coefficient of $T_n$ is divisible by $\pi$, and every monomial of $T_n$ has weight $\leq n$.
	\end{alphanumerate}
	Let's first see why \itememph{*} implies the strong triangle inequality for $v_r$. Let $f,g\in \IA_\inf$, say, $f=\sum_{n=0}^\infty [a_n]\pi^n$, $g=\sum_{n=0}^\infty [b_n]\pi^n$, and let $f+g=\sum_{n=0}^\infty[c_n]\pi^n$. Since $\pi=0$ in $\Oo_F$, we have $c_n=T_n(a_0,\dotsc,a_n,b_0,\dotsc,b_n)^{1/q^n}$. Now let $\alpha X_0^{s_0}\dotsm X_n^{s_n}Y_0^{t_0}\dotsm Y_n^{t_n}$ be a monomial of $T_n$. Since this monomial has weight $\leq n$, we have
	\begin{equation*}
		q^{-n}v\big(\alpha a_0^{s_0}\dotsm a_n^{s_n}b_0^{t_0}\dotsm b_n^{t_n}\big)+rn\geq q^{-n}\sum_{i=0}^n\big(s_i(v(a_i)+ri)+t_i(v(b_i)+ri)\big)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Since the right-hand side is a convex combination of $v(a_i)+ri$ and $v(b_i)+ri$ for $i=0,\dotsc,n$, it is bounded below by the minimal value of these guys. This shows
	\begin{equation*}
		v(c_n)+rn\geq \min_{i=0,\dotsc,n}\left\{v(a_i)+ri,v(b_i)+ri\right\}\,.
	\end{equation*}
	If you think about this a bit, this is enough to prove the strong triangle inequality.
	
	We prove \itememph{*} by induction on $n$. The case $n=0$ is clear. Now assume \itememph{*} holds up to $n-1$. Revisiting the proof of \cref{prop:WittPolynomials}, we see that
	\begin{equation*}
		\snake{S}_n=\pi^{-n}\Bigg(\sum_{i=0}^n\pi^i\left(X_i^{q^n}+Y_i^{q^n}\right)-\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\pi^i\snake{S}_i^{q^{n-i}}\Bigg)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Clearly, all monomials of the first sum have weight at most $n$. For the second sum, our key \cref{lem:keyLemma} implies $\snake{S}_i^{q^{n-i}}\equiv T_i^{q^{n-i}}\mod\pi^{n-i+1}$, and multiplying by $\pi^i$, we get a congruence modulo $\pi^{n+1}$, as usual. Moreover, since all monomials of $T_i$ have weight at most $i$, the same is true for $T_i^{q^{n-i}}$. This shows that $T_n$ can be defined in an appropriate way.
	
	It remains to show $v_r(fg)=v_r(f)+v_r(g)$. In his notes, Johannes Anschütz writes that $v_r(fg)\geq v_r(f)+v_r(g)$ is trivial, but I don't quite agree on that one. It's certainly trivial for power series, but multiplication in $\IA_\inf$ is more complicated than that. So here we sketch a proof: introduce \enquote{twisted Witt polynomials} $\snake{P}_n$ as above. An easy induction shows that $\snake{P}_n$ is homogeneous of degree $2q^n$, and moreover, that it can be written as a polynomial in $Z_{i,j}$, where we put $Z_{i,j}=X_iY_j$ (and then this polynomial has degree $q^n$). As above, we introduce a notion of \defemph{weight} of a monomial $\alpha Z_{i_0,j_0}^{s_0}\dotsm Z_{i_t,j_t}^{s_t}$ of total degree $q^n$. It is defined as $q^{-n}\sum_{k=0}^t(i_k+j_k)s_k$. We claim:
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item[\itememph{\boxtimes}] There is a polynomial $Q_n$ such that $\snake{P}_n\equiv Q_n\mod \pi$, no coefficient of $Q_n$ is divisible by $\pi$, and every monomial of $Q_n$ has weight $\leq n$.
	\end{alphanumerate}
	Claim~\itememph{\boxtimes} can be proved in the exact same way as \itememph{*}. Likewise, we can adapt the above arguments to see that \itememph{\boxtimes} indeed implies $v_r(fg)\geq v_r(f)+v_r(g)$.
	
	To show equality, it suffices to consider the case $r>0$, since it is easy to see that $v_0(f)=\lim_{r\to 0}v_r(f)$, so the $r=0$ case will follow automatically. Let $f=\sum_{n=0}^\infty [a_n]\pi^n$, $g=\sum_{n=0}^\infty [b_n]\pi^n$, and $fg=\sum_{n=0}^\infty[c_n]\pi^n$. Since $r>0$, there are minimal indices $m$, $n$ such that $v(a_m)+rm=v_r(f)$ and $v(b_n)+rn=v_r(g)$. Put $N=m+n$. We will show that $v(c_N)=v(a_m)+v(b_n)$, which will conclude the proof. 
	
	We claim that $(1+\pi \beta)Z_{m,n}^{q^N}$ is a monomial in $Q_N$ for some $\beta\in\Oo_E$. To see this, we use the proof of \cref{prop:WittPolynomials} to get
	\begin{equation*}
		\snake{P}_N=\pi^{-N}\Bigg(\sum_{i=0}^N\pi^iX_i^{q^N}\cdot \sum_{j=0}^N\pi^iY_i^{q^N}-\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\pi^i\snake{P}_i^{q^{N-i}}\Bigg)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Clearly, $\pi^NZ_{m,n}^{q^N}$ occurs as a summand if we expand the product of the two sums. So we only need to show that $Z_{m,n}^{q^N}$ doesn't occur, up to multiples of $\pi^{N+1}$, in the right-most sum. For that, note that $Z_{m,n}^{q^N}$ doesn't occur, up to multiples of $\pi^{N-i+1}$, in any $Q_i^{q^{N-i}}$ for $i\leq N-1$. This follows from \itememph{\boxtimes} as $Z_{m,n}^{q^N}$ has weight $N$. But $\snake{P}_i^{q^{N-i}}\equiv Q_i^{q^{N-i}}\mod \pi^{N-i+1}$ by our key \cref{lem:keyLemma}. This does it.
	
	As in the proof of the strong triangle inequality, $c_N=Q_N(a_0,\dotsc,a_N,b_0,\dotsc,b_N)^{1/q^N}$. If $\alpha Z_{i_0,j_0}^{s_0}\dotsm Z_{i_t,j_t}^{s_t}$ is a monomial of $Q_N$ different from $(1+\pi\beta)Z_{m,n}^{q^N}$, then
	\begin{equation*}
		q^{-N}v\big(\alpha (a_{i_0}b_{j_0})^{s_0}\dotsm (a_{i_t}b_{j_t})^{s_t}\big)+rN\geq q^{-N}\sum_{k=0}^ts_k\big((v(a_{i_k})+ri_k)+(v(b_{j_k})+rj_k)\big)\,,
	\end{equation*}
	using that the monomial in question has weight $\leq N$. The sum on the right-hand side is a convex combination of terms $(v(a_{i_k})+ri_k)+(v(b_{j_k})+rj_k)$ for $k=0,\dotsc,t$, each of which is at least $v_r(f)+v_r(g)$. So the right-hand side is $\geq v_r(f)+v_r(g)$. But since $m$ and $n$ are minimal with the property that $v(a_m)+rm=v_r(f)$ and $v(b_n)+rn=v_r(g)$ and since the weight is $\leq N$, some terms will be strictly greater than $v_r(f)+v_r(g)$. Thus, the right-hand side is $>v_r(f)+v_r(g)=v(a_m)+v(b_n)+rN$. In particular, $(1+\pi\beta)(a_mb_n)^{q^N}$ is the unique summand with minimal valuation, proving indeed $v(c_N)=v(a_m)+v(b_n)$.
\end{proof*}
Let now $a=[a_0]-u\pi$ be an element of $\Prim_1$, where $u\in\IA_\inf^\times$ is a unit and $a_0\in\mm_F\setminus \{0\}$. Put $D=\IA_\inf/a\IA_\inf$. Then we have Fontaine's map $\theta\colon \IA_\inf\morphism D$.
\begin{prop}\label{prop:D}
	Suppose we are in the above situation.
	\begin{numerate}
		\item $D$ is $\pi$-complete and $\pi$-torsionfree.
		\item We have $D^\flat\cong \Oo_F$.
		\item The $p\ordinalth$ power map $D\morphism D$, $x\mapsto x^p$ is surjective. In particular, every element of $D$ is the of the form $\theta([x])$ for some $x\in\Oo_F$.
	\end{numerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof*}
	Part~\itememph{1} and~\itememph{2} are easy: $a$ is distinguished and $\Oo_F$ is $a_0$-complete as $a\in\mm_F$. By \cref{rem:perfectoid}, $(\IA_\inf,a)$ is thus a perfect prism, hence $\pi$-complete by \cref{lem*:perfectoidComplete}. In particular, $D$ is perfectoid, so \itememph{2} already follows from \cref{rem:perfectoid}\itememph{4}. For \itememph{1}, it remains to show that $D$ is $\pi$-torsionfree. Suppose $x,y\in\IA_\inf$ are such that $\pi x=ay$. Put $x=\sum_{n=0}^\infty[x_n]\pi^n$ and $y=\sum_{n=0}^\infty[y_n]\pi^n$. Then $[a_0y_0]=0$, hence $y_0=0$ as $a_0\in\mm_F\setminus\{0\}$. So $y=\pi y'$, and since $\IA_\inf$ is $\pi$-torsionfree, we obtain $x=ay'$. This shows that $D$ is indeed $\pi$-torsionfree.
	
	Proving that the $p\ordinalth$ power map is surjective is a technical nightmare, but I still want to sketch the proof here. The key to the proof is the following claim:
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item[\itememph{*}] For all $x\in\IA_\inf$ with non-zero image in $D$ and all $N\geq 1$ there is an $m\geq 0$ and $y=\sum_{n=0}^\infty[y_n]\pi^n\in\IA_\inf$ such that $v(y_0)< v(a_0)$, $y_n=0$ for all $n=1,\dotsc,N-1$, and
		\begin{equation*}
			x\equiv [a_0]^my\mod a\,.
		\end{equation*}
	\end{alphanumerate}
	We first describe how \itememph{*} implies \itememph{3}. Let $e$ be the ramification index of $\pi$, i.e., $\pi^e\Oo_E=p\Oo_E$, and normalize the valuation $v$ of $\Oo_F$ in such a way that $v(a_0)=1/e$. To show that the image of $x$ in $D$ admits a $p\ordinalth$ root, choose $y$ as above such that $N/e>1+v(a_0)+1/(p-1)$. It suffices to construct a $p\ordinalth$ root of the image of $y$, since $[a_0]$ already admits a $p\ordinalth$ root in $\IA_\inf$. Consider the \enquote{Taylor series expansion of $\sqrt[p]{y}$ around $[y_0]$}, i.e., the series
	\begin{equation*}
		\sum_{n=0}^\infty\prod_{k=0}^n\left(\frac{1-kp}{p}\right)\frac{[y_0]^{(-p(n-1)+1)/p}}{n!}(y-[y_0])^n
	\end{equation*}
	(right now this doesn't make sense at all, but soon it will). We claim that in $D$ this sum can be rewritten into a converging series. It is well-known that $v_p(n!)<n/(p-1)$. Hence the denominator $p^nn!$ divides $\pi^{e(n+n/(p-1))}$ in $\Oo_E$ and thus also in $\IA_\inf$. Likewise, since $v(y_0)<v(a_0)$ and since $[a_0]$ and $\pi$ only differ by a unit in $D$, we see that $[y_0]^{(p(n-1)-1)/p}$ divides $\pi^{n}$ in $D$. Since $y-[y_0]$ is, by assumption on $y$, divisible by $\pi^N$ and $N/e>1+v(a_0)+1/(p-1)$, all terms in the above sum can be interpreted as elements of $D$, and moreover they converge to $0$ in the $\pi$-adic topology. By \itememph{1}, $D$ is $\pi$-complete, so we can indeed represent $\sqrt[p]{y}$ as a convergent series in $D$.
	
	It suffices to show \itememph{*}. If $v(x_0)\geq v(a_0)$, we may subtract a suitable multiple of $a$ to kill the $\pi^0$-term of $x$. In other words, we find $x'$ such that $x\equiv \pi x'\equiv [a_0]u^{-1}x'\mod a$. Now iterate this argument for $u^{-1}x'$. If this doesn't end at some point, the image of $x$ in $D$ is divisible by arbitrary powers of $\pi$, hence $0$ by $\pi$-completeness.
	
	So let's assume $v(x_0)<v(a_0)$. Then it's easy to check that $v(y_0)<v(a_0)$ for all $y\in\IA_\inf$ satisfying $x\equiv y\mod a$. Therefore it suffices to find some $b\in \IA_\inf$ such that $y=x+ab$ satisfies $y_n=0$ for all $n=1,\dotsc,N-1$. We will see that this amounts to a system of polynomial equations for $b_0,\dotsc,b_{N-1}$, which has a solution in $\Oo_F$. To get $y_n=0$, we would like to have
	\begin{equation*}
		S_n\left(x_0^{q^0},\dotsc,x_n^{q^n},Q_0,\dotsc,Q_n\right)=0\quad\text{for all }n=1,\dotsc,N-1\,,
	\end{equation*}
	where $Q_n=Q_n(a_0,\dotsc,a_n,b_0,\dotsc,b_n)$ is defined as in the proof of Lemma~\cref{lem:vrValuation}. If $b_0,\dotsc,b_{n-1}$ are known, then $S_n=0$ uniquely determines $b_n$. Indeed, using the recursive definition of the $S_n$ (compare this to the proof of Lemma~\cref{lem:vrValuation}), we see that $b_n$ only occurs in the summand $Q_n$. And in $Q_n$, $b_n$ only occurs as $a_0^{q^n}b_n^{q^n}$. This shows that $b_n^{q^n}=-\text{some polynomial in $b_0,\dotsc,b_{n-1}$})/a_0^{q^n}$ is uniquely determined, and then $b_n$ is unique since the Frobenius is an automorphism of $\Oo_F$. Moreover, we need to ensure that the value of the polynomial in question is divisible by $a_0^{q^n}$, to get $b_n\in\Oo_F$.
	
	Our goal now is to use the above observation to eliminate $b_1,\dotsc,b_{N-2}$ from the equations. We know that $b_1^q$ is a polynomial (with coefficients not in $\Oo_F$, but in $a_0^{-1}\Oo_F$) in $b_0$. Replacing all subsequent polynomial equations by their $q\ordinalth$ powers, which we may do since the Frobenius is an automorphism, we may substitute each $b_1^q$ by the polynomial in $b_0$ to eliminate $b_1$ everywhere. Now repeat this procedure with $b_2,\dotsc,b_{N-2}$. What we obtain in the end is a huge polynomial $\Psi(b_0)$ with coefficients in $a_0^{-K}\Oo_F$ for some very large $K$. We want to choose $b_0$ to be a root of $\Psi$, to get that $b_{N-1}^{q^M}=-\Psi(b_0)/a_0^{q^M}=0$ (for some very large $M$) is in $\Oo_F$ (actually, it would suffice to choose $b_0$ in such a way that $\Psi(b_0)$ is divisible by a very large power of $a_0$). To show that the roots of $\Psi$ are in $\Oo_F$, we claim that $\Psi$ is \defemph{quasi-monic}, which is to say that all coefficients of $\Psi$ are in $a_0^{-K}\Oo_F$ for some $K$ and its leading coefficient has the form $\epsilon a_0^{-K}$, where $\epsilon\in\Oo_F^\times$ is a unit. For a quasi-monic polynomial, $-K$ as above is called its \defemph{valuation}.
	
	Let $b_n^{q^{M_n}}=-\Psi_n(b_0)$ be the polynomial equation we get by the above procedure.	We claim that all $\Psi_n$ are quasi-monic, and that the valuation of $\Psi_n$ is smaller than that of $\Psi_{n-1}$. This can be seen by induction on $n$. The key part in the inductive step is that $Q_n$ contains the monomial $a_1^{q^n}b_{n-1}^{q^n}$ up to multiples of $\pi$ (this was seen in the proof of Lemma~\cref{lem:vrValuation}). Moreover, any other monomial containing $b_{n-1}^{q^n}$ must also contain $a_0$ since its weight is $\leq n$. Now $a_1^{q^n}\in\Oo_F^\times$ and $a_0\in\mm_F\setminus\{0\}$ by assumption on $a$, so if we group all monomials containing $b_{n-1}^{q^n}$ we get a coefficient in $\Oo_F^\times$. This being the key idea, we omit the details of the induction.
	
	In particular, this shows that $\Psi$ is quasi-monic since it is a the product of $\Psi_{N-1}$ with some power of $a_0$. So $b_0,b_{N-1}\in \Oo_F$ by construction. For $n=1,\dotsc,N-2$ we define $b_n=-\Psi_n(b_0)$. By construction, $(b_0,\dotsc,b_{N-1})$ satisfy all polynomial equations, so it suffices to see $b_n\in\Oo_F$ for all $n=1,\dotsc,N-2$. If, for the sake of contradiction, $n$ is a minimal index such that $0>v(b_n)$, then an induction as above shows $v(b_n)>v(b_{n+1})>\dotsb>v(b_{N-1})$, contradicting $b_{N-1}\in\Oo_F$.
	
	This shows that $D$ admits $p\ordinalth$ roots. To finish the proof of \itememph{3}, we need to show that every $d\in D$ is of the form $\theta([x])$. Using \cref{lem:WAb->A}, it suffices to show that $(-)^\sharp\colon \Oo_F\morphism D$ is surjective. But \itememph{2} together with \cref{prop:(A/I)b} shows $\Oo_F\cong D^\flat\cong \limit_{d\mapsto d^q}D$. Since $D$ admits $p\ordinalth$ roots, it's clear that the right-hand side surjects onto $D$.
\end{proof*}
\begin{cor}\label{cor:D}
	Suppose we are in the above situation.
	\begin{numerate}
		\item $D$ is a complete valuation ring, with well-defined valuation $v\colon D\morphism\IR\cup\{\infty\}$ constructed as follows: for $d=\theta([x])$ we put $v(d)=v_F(x)$, where $v_F$ denotes the valuation of $F$.
		\item The fraction field $C=\Frac(D)$ is algebraically closed.
	\end{numerate}
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
	We start with \itememph{1}. The first thing to show is that $v$ is well-defined. Suppose $x,y\in \Oo_F$ satisfy $x^\sharp=\theta([x])=\theta([y])=y^\sharp$ (the outer equalities are due to \cref{lem:WAb->A}). Suppose $v_F(x)\geq v_F(y)$, so w.l.o.g.\ $x=yz$. Then $z^\sharp=1$, and it suffices to show $z\in\Oo_F^\times$. Write $z=(z_0,z_1,\dotsc)\in\limit_{d\mapsto d^q}D$, where $z_0=1$. Then each $z_n$ is invertible in $D$, so $z$ is invertible in $D^\flat\cong \Oo_F$.
	
	We proceed to show that $D$ is an integral domain. Assume $de=0$ with $d,e\in D$. Write $d=x^\sharp$ and $e=y^\sharp$. Then $[xy]=az$ for some $z\in \IA_\inf$. But $\Newt([xy])$ is a horizontal line, whereas $\Newt(az)=\Newt(a)*\Newt(z)$ contains $-v(a_0)$ as a slope if $z\neq 0$.
	
	Now it is completely formal to see that $D$ is a valuation ring. The map $v$ clearly extends to $C=\Frac(D)$ via $v(d/e)=v_F(x)-v_F(y)$ if $d=x^\sharp$ and $e=y^\sharp$. This $v$ is multiplicative and satisfies $v(d/e)=\infty$ iff $d/e=0$. Moreover, an element $d/e\in C$ lies in $D$ precisely iff $v(d/e)>0$. Indeed, if $x$ and $y$ are as above, then $v_F(x)\geq v_F(y)$, hence $x=yz$ because $\Oo_F$ is a valuation ring. Then $d/e=z^\sharp\in D$. This already implies the strong triangle inequality: if $d,e\in D$ and $v(d)\geq v(e)$, then $d/e\in D$, hence $v(1+d/e)\geq 0$, hence $v(d+e)=v(e)+v(1+d/e)\geq v(e)$. This proves \itememph{1}.
	
	For \itememph{2}, let $P(T)=T^n+b_{n-1}T^{n-1}+\dotsb+b_0\in D[T]$ be an irreducible polynomial. Since $C$ is a non-archimedean field (which, by our convention, always implies completeness), the Newton polygon $\Newt_\poly(P)$ is a single line. This follows from the classical theory of Newton polygons (e.g.\ \cite[Ch.\:II\:(6.4)]{NEUKIRCH}), or from \cref{exm:NewtConvolution} if one shows that all roots of $P$ have the same valuation, which boils down to the fact that $v$ extends uniquely to any finite extension of $C$. Choose $c_0\in D$ such that $nv(c_0)=v(b_0)$ (such a $c_0$ exists by construction of $v$ and the fact that $\Oo_F$ is integrally closed). Since $\Newt_\poly(P)$ is a single line, $c_0^{-n}P(c_0T)$ is monic and has coefficients in $D$ again, where  Replacing $P$ by $c_0^{-n}P(c_0T)$ we may thus assume $v(b_0)=0$.
	
	Now let $Q_0\in\Oo_F[T]$ be a monic polynomial such that the images of $P$ and $Q_0$ in the polynomial ring $(D/\pi D)[T]\cong (\Oo_F/a_0\Oo_F)[T]$ coincide. Let $y_0\in \Oo_F$ be a zero of $Q_0$. Then $P(T+y_0^\sharp)$ is still irreducible and its constant coefficient is divisible by $\pi$. Now choose $c_1\in D$ such that $nv(c_1)=v(P(y_0^\sharp))\geq v(\pi)$. As above, $P_1(T)=c_1^{-n}P(c_1T+y_0^\sharp)$ is monic, has coefficients in $D$, and its constant coefficient is invertible. Now choose $Q_1$ and $y_1$ as above and iterate the argument. The series $y_0+c_1y_1+\dotsb$ converges to a zero of $P$.
\end{proof}
We can now finally prove \cref{lem:perfectoidOC}, a result that was already announced long ago in the $2\ordinalnd$ lecture.
\begin{proof*}[Proof of \cref{lem:perfectoidOC}]
	Combining \cref{lem:OcflatisOF} and \cref{cor:D} immediately shows this result. More generally, these results show that there is a bijection
	\begin{equation*}
		\{\text{iso.\ classes of }C/E\text{ non-arch.\ alg.\ closed s.th. }\Oo_C^\flat\cong \Oo_F\}\lrisomorphism \Prim_1/\IA_\inf^\times\,.
	\end{equation*}
	If $C/E$ is as on the left-hand side, then $\Oo_C$ is perfectoid by Example~\cref{exm:OCperfectoid}, hence the kernel of $\theta\colon \IA_\inf\morphism\Oo_C$ is generated by an element of $\Prim_1$, which is unique up to $\IA_\inf$. Conversely, if $a\in \Prim_1$ is given, then $D=\IA_\inf/a\IA_\inf$ and $C=\Frac(D)$ define an element of the left-hand side. These maps induce inverse bijections as required.
\end{proof*}
\subsection{The Space \texorpdfstring{$|Y|$}{|Y|} and Factorizations}
\lecture[Elements of $\IA_\inf$ are \enquote{functions on $|Y|$}. An ultra-metric on $|Y|$. Proof of \cref{thm:NewtonSlope}.]{2019-11-20}Let notation be as usual and recall our construction of the Newton polygon for elements of $\IA_\inf$ in \cref{def:AinfNewton}. The goal for today is to prove the following analogue of Lazard's \cref{thm:Lazard}.
\begin{thm}[Fargues--Fontaine]\label{thm:NewtonSlope}
	If $f\in\IA_\inf$ and $\lambda\neq 0$ is a slope of $\Newt(f)$, then there exists an $a\in\Oo_F$ such that $v(a)=-\lambda$ and $f=(\pi-[a])g$ for some $g\in\IA_\inf$.
\end{thm}
Crucial to the proof of \cref{thm:NewtonSlope} will be to interpret $\IA_\inf$ as \enquote{functions on the punctured open unit disc in mixed characteristic}. This leads to the following definition.
\begin{defi}
	We define the space
	\begin{align*}
		|Y|&\coloneqq\left\{\pp\in\Spec\IA_\inf\st\pp\text{ is generated by a primitve element of degree $1$}\right\}\\
		&\mathrel{{\phantom{\coloneqq}}\mathllap{\cong}} \Prim_1/\IA_\inf^\times\\
		&\mathrel{{\phantom{\coloneqq}}\mathllap{\cong}}\{\text{iso.\ classes of }C/E\text{ non-arch.\ alg.\ closed s.th. }\Oo_C^\flat\cong \Oo_F\}
	\end{align*}
\end{defi}
Note that $\mm_F\setminus\{0\}$ surjects onto $|Y|$ via $a\mapsto(\pi-[a])$ (to prove this, we must show that any $[a_0]-u\pi\in\Prim_1$ can be multiplied by a suitable unit to become of the form $\pi-[a]$; the coefficients of such a unit can be constructed inductively), but this need not be a bijection. The notation suggests that $|Y|$ should be thought of the underlying space of some $Y$. This should not be taken too literally, but in some sense this is indeed the case. More about this in \cref{rem:Y}
\begin{nota}
	\begin{numerate}
		\item For $y\in|Y|$, let $\pp_y$ denote the corresponding prime ideal, $C_y$ its residue field which is a non-archimedean algebraically closed extension of $E$ with valuation $v_y\colon C_y\morphism \IR\cup\{\infty\}$, and finally let $\theta_y\colon \IA_\inf\morphism\Oo_{C_y}$  denote Fontaine's map.
		\item For $f\in\IA_\inf$, let $f(y)$ denote the class of $f$ in $C_y$ (think of this as \enquote{$f\in\Global(|Y|,\Oo_{|Y|})$}), and for $y\in |Y|$ we put $v(f(y))=v_y(f)$.
		\item For $y_1,y_2\in|Y|$, we put $d(y_1,y_2)=v_{y_1}(\theta_{y_1}(\xi_{y_2}))$, where $\xi_{y_2}\in\pp_{y_2}$ is a distinguished generator. We will see in \cref{lem:d} below that $d(-,-)$ defines a ultra-metric on $|Y|$. In particular, $d(y,0)=v_y(\pi(y))$ is in some sense the \enquote{distance to the origin}.
	\end{numerate}
\end{nota}
\begin{rem}\label{rem:Y}
	\begin{numerate}
		\item One can define $\Yy=\Spf(\IA_\inf)^\mathrm{ad}\setminus V(\pi[\varpi])$ as an adic space, where $\varpi\in\mm_f\setminus\{0\}$. Then $|Y|\subseteq \Yy$ is the set of classical points, and $\IA_\inf\subseteq \Global(\Yy,\Oo_\Yy)$.
		\item There is a properly discontinuous action $\phi\curvearrowright\Yy$ (think of this as \enquote{$d(\phi(y),0)=\frac1qd(y,0)$}). One can define $\Xx=\Yy/\phi^\IZ$, the \enquote{adic Fargues--Fontaine curve}.
	\end{numerate}
\end{rem}
Now we can reformulate \cref{thm:NewtonSlope} as follows: if $f\in\IA_\inf$ and $\lambda\neq 0$ is a slope of $\Newt(f)$, then there exists a $y\in |Y|$ such that $v(\pi(y))=-\lambda$ and $f(y)=0$. This is the form in which we will prove it below.
\begin{lem}\label{lem:d}
	For $r\geq 0$ let $\aa_r=\left\{x\in\IA_\inf\st v_0(x)\geq r\right\}$. Then for all $y_1,y_2\in|Y|$,
	\begin{equation*}
		d(y_1,y_2)=\sup\left\{r\st \pp_{y_1}+\aa_r=\pp_{y_2}+\aa_r\right\}\,.
	\end{equation*}
	In particular, $d\colon |Y|\times|Y|\morphism \IR\cup\{\infty\}$ is an ultra-metric.\footnote{As a slogan, an ultra-metric is related to a metric in the same way a valuation is related to a (non-archimedean) norm.} That is:
	\begin{numerate}
		\item $d(y_1,y_2)=d(y_2,y_1)$.
		\item For all $y_3\in|Y|$, $d(y_1,y_2)\geq \min\{d(y_1,y_2),d(y_2,y_3)\}$.
		\item $d(y_1,y_2)=\infty$ iff $y_1=y_2$.

\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\pp_{y_i}=(\xi_{y_i})$ and write $\xi_{y_1}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty [x_n]\xi_{y_2}^n$. The coefficients $x_n$ exist and can be constructed inductively as follows: since $(-)^\sharp\colon \Oo_F\cong \Oo_{C_{y_2}}^\flat\epimorphism \Oo_{C_{y_2}}$ is surjective by \cref{prop:D}\itememph{3}, the image of $\xi_{y_1}$ in $\Oo_{C_{y_2}}$ has the form $\theta([x_0])$. As $(\xi_{y_2})=\ker\theta_{y_2}$, $\xi'=\xi_{y_1}-[x_0]$ is divisible by $\xi_{y_2}$. Now iterate the argument for $\xi_{y_2}^{-1}\xi'$. Then
	\begin{equation*}
		d(y_2,y_1)=v_{y_2}\big(\theta_{y_2}(\xi_{y_1})\big)=v(x_0)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Applying $\theta_{y_1}$, we see $0=\theta_{y_1}(\xi_{y_1})=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\theta_{y_1}([x_n])\theta_{y_1}(\xi_{y_2}^n)$, hence
	\begin{equation*}
		\theta_{y_1}([x_0])=\theta_{y_1}(\xi_{y_2})\Bigg(\sum_{n=1}^\infty\theta_{y_1}([x_n])\theta_{y_1}(\xi_{y_2})^{n-1}\Bigg)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Note that the sum on the left-hand side is convergent in $\Oo_{C_{y_1}}$ because in $\xi_{y_2}=[a_{y_2}]-u_{y_2}\pi$ both $a_{y_2}\in\mm_F$ and $\pi$ have positive valuation. This shows
	\begin{equation*}
		d(y_2,y_1)=v(x_0)=v_{y_1}\big(\theta_{y_1}([x_0])\big)\geq v_{y_1}\big(\theta_{y_1}(\xi_{y_2})\big)=d(y_1,y_2)\,,
	\end{equation*}
	with equality iff $v_{y_1}(\theta_{y_1}([x_1]))=0$, which is fulfilled iff $x_1\in\Oo_F^\times$. But by symmetry we also get $d(y_1,y_2)\geq d(y_2,y_1)$, hence equality must hold.
	
	In particular $x_1\in\Oo_F^\times$ is indeed true. Thus, $\xi_{y_1}=[x_0]+u\xi_{y_2}$ for some unit $u\in \IA_\inf^\times$. This shows $\pp_{y_1}+\aa_{v(x_0)}=\pp_{y_2}+\aa_{v(x_0)}$. Therefore
	\begin{equation*}
		d(y_1,y_2)\leq \sup\left\{r\st \pp_{y_1}+\aa_r=\pp_{y_2}+\aa_r\right\}\,.
	\end{equation*}
	It remains to show the converse inequality. Let $r\geq 0$ such that $\pp_{y_1}+\aa_r=\pp_{y_2}+\aa_r$. Applying $\theta_{y_2}$, we see the ideal $\theta_{y_2}(\xi_{y_1})\Oo_{C_{y_2}}=\theta_{y_2}([x_0])\Oo_{C_{y_2}}$ is continued in $\left\{c\in\Oo_{C_{y_2}}\st v_{y_2}(c)\geq r\right\}$. Thus $v(x_0)=v_{y_2}(\theta_{y_2}([x_0]))\geq r$. This shows $d(y_1,y_2)\geq r$, as required.
	
	Properties \itememph{1} and \itememph{2} are now clear. For \itememph{3}, we observe that $\Oo_{C_{y_1}}\cong \IA_\inf/\pp_{y_1}$ is complete in its valuative topology, which is the topology induced by the images of the $\aa_r$. Thus, $\pp_{y_1}=\bigcap_{r\geq 0}(\pp_{y_1}+\aa_r)$. The same is true for $\pp_{y_2}$. Now $\dim(y_1,y_2)=\infty$ implies $\bigcap_{r\geq 0}(\pp_{y_1}+\aa_r)=\bigcap_{r\geq 0}(\pp_{y_2}+\aa_r)$. Therefore $\pp_{y_1}=\pp_{y_2}$, as required.

\numpar{Proposition \smash{\Attention}}\label{prop:YrComplete}
\itshape For $r>0$, the space $|Y_r|$ is complete with respect to the ultra-metric $d$.\upshape
\begin{proof}
	Let $(y_n)_{n\in\IN}$ be a Cauchy sequence in $|Y_r|$. We need to show that $(y_n)_{n\in\IN}$ converges. To this end we claim:
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item[\itememph{*}] For all $s>0$ the sequence $(\pp_{y_n}+\aa_s)_{n\in\IN}$ of ideals is constant for $n\gge 0$.
	\end{alphanumerate}
	Indeed, there exists a $n_0$ such that $d(y_n,y_m)>s$ for all $n,m\geq n_0$. By \cref{lem:d} this implies $\pp_{y_n}+\aa_{s}=\pp_{y_m}+\aa_{s}$ and \itememph{*} is proven.
	
	Set $I_s=(\pp_{y_n}+\aa_s)/\aa_s\subseteq \IA_\inf/\aa_s$, where $n\gge 0$ so that the eventual constant value is reached. Put $I=\lim_{s\geq 0}I_s$. This is an ideal in $\lim_{s\geq 0}\IA_\inf/\aa_s\cong \IA_\inf$ (here we use that $\IA_\inf$ is $v_0$-complete; to prove this, you can use the first part of the proof of \cref{lem*:nonTrivial}). Then $I_s=(I+\aa_s)/\aa_s$. We claim:
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item[\itememph{\boxtimes}] The ideal $I$ is a prime ideal generated by a primitive element of degree $1$, and $(\pp_{y_n})_{n\in\IN}$ converges to $I$ (and then automatically $I\in |Y_r|$; indeed, if the sequence is to converge in $|Y|$ at all, then the limit will be in $|Y_r|$ since this is  a closed subspace).
	\end{alphanumerate}
	To prove this, fix $s>r$ and $n\gge 0$ such that $\pp_{y_n}+\aa_s=I+\aa_s$. Writing $\pp_{y_n}=(\xi_{y_n})$, we see that there exists $x\in\aa_s$ such that $a\coloneqq \xi_{y_n}+x$ is an element of $I$. Then $a\in\Prim_1$. Indeed, writing $\xi_{y_n}=[\xi_0]+[\xi_1]\pi+\dotsb$ and $x=[x_0]+[x_1]\pi+\dotsb$, we get $v(\xi_0)=r$ and $v(\xi_1)=0$ because $\xi_{y_n}$ is a distinguished generator of $\pp_{y_n}\in|Y_r|$, and $v(x_0),v(x_1)\geq s> r$ because $x\in\aa_s$. Then using the explicit descriptions for the first two coefficients of $a$ one easily confirms $a\in\Prim_1$.
	
	We claim that $a$ generates $I$. Clearly $(a)\subseteq I$, so assume this inclusion is not an equality. Since $\IA_\inf/(a)$ is a valuation ring by \cref{cor:D}\itememph{1}, there exists $r_0>0$ such that $(a)+\aa_{r_0}\subseteq I$. Let $t>\max\{r_0,s\}$ and choose $m$ such that $I+\aa_t=\pp_{y_m}+\aa_t$. But since $\aa_{r_0}\subseteq I\subseteq \pp_{y_m}+\aa_t$ we get $r_0\geq t$ (after applying $\theta_{y_m}$), a contradiction!
	
	Now that we know $I\in|Y|$, it's clear that $(\pp_{y_n})_{n\in\IN}$ converges to $I$ as $n\to \infty$, because $\pp_{y_n}+\aa_s=I+\aa_s$ for all $s>0$ and $n\gge 0$. This proves \itememph{\boxtimes} and we are done.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Sketch of a proof of \cref{thm:NewtonSlope}]
	\emph{Step~1.} We reduce to the case where $f\in\IA_\inf$ is primitive of some degree $d$. So assume the assertion is proved in this case and write $f=\sum_{i=0}^\infty [x_i]\pi^i$, $f_n=\sum_{i=0}^n[x_i]\pi^i$. Each $f_n$ is primitive of some degree up to multiplying by a Teichmüller element, so the theorem holds for the $f_n$. Choose $n_0$ such that for all $n\geq n_0$, $\lambda$ occurs as a slope in $\Newt(f_n)$ with the same multiplicity it does in $\Newt(f)$. Let $Y_n=\left\{y\in|Y|\st f(y)=0\text{ and }d(y,0)=-\lambda\right\}$. It suffices to show that we can find a Cauchy sequence $(y_n)_{n\in\IN}$ such that $y_n\in Y_n$. Indeed, by Proposition~\cref{prop:YrComplete}, this sequence converges to a limit $y\in |Y_{-\lambda}|$. We claim that $f(y)=0$. To see this, it suffices to show $v_y(f)\geq r$ for all $r>0$. Choose $N$ such that $-\lambda N>r$ and $N'$ such that $d(y_n,y)>r$ for all $n\geq N'$. Now if $n\geq\max\{N,N'\}$ we have $v_{y_n}(f)\geq (n+1)v_y(\pi)=-\lambda(n+1)>r$ since $f_n(y_n)=0$ and $f-f_n$ is divisible by $\pi^{n+1}$. Hence $f\in\pp_{y_n}+\aa_r$. But $d(y_n,y)>r$ implies $\pp_{y_n}+\aa_r=\pp_y+\aa_r$ by \cref{lem:d}, hence also $v_y(f)\geq r$.
	
	So it remains to construct the Cauchy sequence. We will only hint on how to do that. Let $m<n$ be very large and let $y_n$ be a zero of $f_n$. We wish to find a zero $y_m$ of $f_m$ that is close to $y_n$. Using the theorem repeatedly on $f_m$, we can factor it as $f_m=\xi_1\dotsm\xi_\ell\cdot [a] u$, where $\xi_1,,\dots,\xi_\ell$ are distinguished elements corresponding to the roots of $f_m$ inside $|Y|$, $a\in\Oo_F$ is some element, and $u\in\IA_\inf^\times$ is a unit. Clearly $v_{y_n}(u)=0$ and $v_{y_n}([a])=v(a)\leq v_0(f_m)$. Let $x_i\in|Y|$ be the zero corresponding to $\xi_i$. There are only a bounded number, say at most $N$, of $x_i$ with $d(x_i,0)>-\lambda$, since these correspond to smaller slopes of $\Newt(f)$, and the strong triangle inequality gives $d(x_i,y_n)=-\lambda$ in this case. Similarly, there are at most $M$ indices such that $d(x_i,0)=-\lambda$ (these are the interesting ones). All the rest satisfies $d(x_i,0)<-\lambda$, hence $d(x_i,y_n)\leq -\lambda'$ by the strong triangle inequality, where $\lambda'>\lambda$ is the next slope after $\lambda$ in $\Newt(f)$. Thus,
	\begin{align*}
		v_{y_n}(f_m)&=\sum_{i=0}^\ell v_{y_n}(\xi_i)+v_{y_n}([a]u)=\sum_{i=0}^\ell d(x_i,y_n)+v_{y_n}([a]u)\\
		&\leq N\lambda+\sum_{d(x_i,0)=-\lambda}d(x_i,y_n)+(\ell-M-N)\lambda'+v_0(f)\,.
	\end{align*}
	However, $v_{y_n}(f_m)\geq (m+1)v_{y_n}(\pi)=-\lambda(m+1)$ since $f_n(y_n)=0$ and $f_n-f_m$ is divisible by $\pi^{m+1}$. This shows that $\sum_{d(x_i,0)=-\lambda}d(x_i,y_n)$ must be quite large. But these are at most $M$ summands, so we find a summand such that $d(x_i,y_n)$ is pretty large. Now take $y_m=x_i$. Up to some technical stuff we will omit, this allows us to construct the desired Cauchy sequence.
	
	\emph{Step~2.} Having done the reduction to $f\in\Prim_d$ for some $d$, we may moreover assume that $\lambda$ is the maximal slope of $\Newt(f)$ (i.e., the least steep, since all slopes are negative), by factorizing $f$ and using induction. We claim that there exists a sequence $(y_n)_{n\in\IN}$ in $|Y|$ satisfying
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item $v_{y_n}(f)\geq -\lambda(d+n)$,
		\item $d(y_n,y_{n+1})\geq -\lambda(d+n)/d$, and
		\item $d(y_n,0)=-\lambda$ for all $n\in\IN$.
	\end{alphanumerate}
	This will immediately imply the theorem, since \itememph{b} and \itememph{c} show that $(y_n)_{n\in\IN}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $|Y_{\-\lambda}|$, hence convergent by Proposition~\cref{prop:YrComplete}, and \itememph{a} ensures that the limit $y$ is a zero of $f$ by a similar argument as above. We will construct this sequence inductively.
	
	Write $f= \sum_{n=0}^\infty[x_n]\pi^n$, where $x_d\in\Oo_F^\times$. Let $z\in\Oo_F$ be a zero of $\sum_{i=0}^dx_iT^i\in\Oo_F[T]$ such that $v(z)=-\lambda$, using that $F$ is non-archimedean algebraically closed (and for $v(z)=-\lambda$ we use the classical Newton polygon theory, as in \cref{exm:NewtConvolution}). As $\lambda <0$ is the maximal slope, we have $v(x_i)\geq \lambda(d-i)$ for all $i=0,\dotsc,d$. Thus $x_iz^i=w_iz^d$ for some $w_i\in\Oo_F$. Now put $\pp_{y_1}=(\pi-[z])$. Clearly $y_1$ satisfies \itememph{c}. Moreover,
	\begin{equation*}
		f(y_1)=\theta_{y_1}(f)=\sum_{i=0}^d\theta_{y_1}([x_iz^i])+\pi^{d+1}\sum_{i=d+1}^\infty\theta_{y_1}([x_i])\pi^{i-(d+1)}\,.
	\end{equation*}
	To show \itememph{a} for $y_1$, it suffices to check that the first sum is divisible by $\pi^{d+1}$. As $x_iz^i=w_iz^d$ and $\pi=[z]$ in $\Oo_{C_{y_1}}$, we get
	\begin{equation*}
		\sum_{i=0}^d\theta_{y_1}([x_iz^i])=\pi^d\sum_{i=0}^d\theta_{y_1}([w_i])\,.
	\end{equation*}
	By construction of $z$ and the $w_i$ we have $\sum_{i=0}^dw_i=0$. Hence $\sum_{i=0}^d[w_i]\in\pi\IA_\inf$, whence we conclude that \itememph{a} holds for $y_1$. Since we were cut short by a sudden evaluation of the lecture, we will finish the induction next time \dotso
	
	\lecture[Finish the proof of \cref{thm:NewtonSlope}. An amusing exercise. The rings $B^b$ and $B_I$. Definition of the Fargues--Fontaine curve. Newton polygons in $B_I$.]{2019-11-27}\dotso that is, right now. Assume $y_n$ has been constructed. As in the proof of \cref{lem:d}, we can write $f=\sum_{i=0}^\infty [a_i]\xi_{y_n}^i$ with $a_i\in\Oo_F$. Let $z\in F$ be a zero of $\sum_{i=0}^da_iT^i\in\Oo_F[T]$ of maximal valuation. We claim $z\in\Oo_F$. To see this, it suffices to check $a_d\in\Oo_F^\times$, i.e., that $a_d$ maps to a unit in $k=\Oo_F/\mm_F$. Consider $\IA_\inf\morphism W_{\Oo_E}(k)$, where $k=\Oo_F/\mm_F$. Since we can choose $\xi_{y_n}$ to be of the form $\pi-[\varpi]$ with $\varpi\in \mm_F$, its image in $W_{\Oo_E}(k)$ coincides with the image of $\pi$. Thus, reducing $f=\sum_{i=0}^\infty [a_i]\xi_{y_n}^i$ modulo $\mm_F$ shows $a_d\equiv x_d\mod \mm_F$, so $a_d\in\Oo_F^\times$ is indeed a unit. Now we claim that $\pp_{y_{n+1}}=(\xi_{y_n}-[z])$ works.
	
	First of all, since $z$ has maximal valuation among the $d$ zeros of $\sum_{i=0}^da_iT^i$, we get $v(z)\geq v(a_0)/d=v_{y_n}(f)/d\geq -\lambda(d+n)/d$. In particular, $v(z)>-\lambda$, so by the explicit descriptions of $S_0$ and $S_1$ it's easy to check that $\xi_{y_n}-[z_{n+1}]$ is primitive of degree $1$, hence $y_{n+1}\in|Y|$. Moreover, $d(y_n,y_{n+1})=v_{y_n}(-[z])=v(z)\geq -\lambda(d+n)/d$, as required. By the strong triangle inequality this also implies $d(y_{n+1},0)$, so \itememph{b} and \itememph{c} hold. It remains to check \itememph{a}. Since $v(z)$ is maximal among the zeros of $\sum_{i=0}^da_iT^i$, $-v(z)$ is the minimal (i.e., steepest) slope in the Newton polygon of that polynomial. In other words, $v(a_i)\geq v(a_0)-iv(z)$. Thus we may write $a_iz^i=a_0b_i$. Calculating in a similar way as above, we obtain
	\begin{equation*}
		f(y_{n+1})=\theta_{y_{n+1}}(f)=\theta_{y_{n+1}}([a_0])\sum_{i=0}^d\theta_{y_{n+1}}([b_i])+\xi_{y_n}^{d+1}\sum_{i=d+1}^\infty \theta_{y_{n+1}}([a_i])\xi_{y_n}^{i-(d+1)}\,.
	\end{equation*}
	By construction we have $\sum_{i=0}^db_i=0$ (or $a_0=0$, but in this case $f(y_n)=0$ and we are already done), hence $\sum_{i=0}^d[b_i]\in\pi\IA_\inf$. Thus, the first term has valuation at least $v(a_0)+v_{y_{n+1}}(\pi)=v(a_0)+d(y_{n+1},0)\geq -\lambda (d+n+1)$. The second term has valuation at least $(d+1)v_{y_{n+1}}(\xi_{y_n})=(d+1)d(y_n,y_{n+1})\geq -\lambda(d+1)(d+n)/d>-\lambda(d+n+1)$. This shows
	\begin{equation*}
		v_{y_{n+1}}(f)\geq -\lambda(d+n+1)\,,
	\end{equation*}
	hence \itememph{a} holds and the induction is complete.

\section{The Ring \texorpdfstring{$B$}{B}}
As usual, let $p$ be a prime, $E/\IQ_p$ a finite extension with uniformizer $\pi\in\Oo_E$ and residue field $\IF_q=\Oo_E/\pi \Oo_E$, and $F/\IF_q$ an algebraically closed non-archimedean field extension (i.e., $F$ is complete with respect to a non-archimedean valuation $v\colon F\morphism \IR\cup\{\infty\}$).

To warm up for the construction of $B$, we first define its \enquote{bounded version} $B^b$ as follows: for $\varpi\in\mm_F\setminus\{0\}$ we put
\begin{equation*}
	B^b=\IA_\inf\big[\textstyle\frac{1}{\pi},\frac{1}{[\varpi]}\big]\displaystyle=\left\{\sum_{i\gge -\infty}^\infty [x_i]\pi^i\st x_i=0\text{ for }i\lle 0\text{, }\inff_{i\in\IZ}v(x_i)>-\infty\right\}\,.
\end{equation*}
Here we allow the notation $[x]$ also for elements $x\in F$ that need not be in $\Oo_F$. This works as follows: for sufficiently large $n$, we have $\varpi^nx\in\Oo_F$. Then we put $[x]=[\varpi^nx]/[\varpi]^n$, which is indeed an element of $B^b$. And since the Teichmüller lift $[-]$ is multiplicative, it's clear that $[x]$ is independent of the choice of $n$, thus well-defined. Also $B^b$ is clearly independent of the choice of $\varpi$.

Recall the valuations $v_r\colon \IA_\inf\morphism\IR\cup\{\infty\}$ from Lemma~\cref{lem:vrValuation}. Then $v_r$ and the construction of the Newton polygon can be extended to $B^b$; $v_r$ can now attain negative values, and the Newton polygon of an element $f\in \Newt(f)$ need not be contained in the first quadrant $[0,\infty)\times [0,\infty)\subseteq \IR^2$, but in $[x,\infty)\times[y,\infty)$ for some $x,y\in \IR$.
\begin{defi}
	Let $I\subseteq (0,\infty)$ be an intervall. We define the \defemph{ring $B_I$} to be the completion of $B^b$ with respect to the family of valuations $\{v_r\}_{r\in I}$.
\end{defi}
The intuition behind this is that \enquote{$B_I=\Global(|Y_I|,\Oo_{|Y|})$}, where $|Y_I|$ denotes the \enquote{annulus} $\left\{y\in |Y|\st d(y,0)\in I\right\}$ that is depicted below.

\begin{rem}
	If $R$ is a topological ring such that $0$ has a fundamental system $\Ff$ of neighbourhoods which are open subgroups, then
	\begin{equation*}
		\roof{R}=\limit_{U\in\Ff}R/U
	\end{equation*}
	is the completion of $R$. Here $R/U$ is a priori only an abelian group since $U$ need not be an ideal. However, by continuity of multiplication in $R$, the completion $\roof{R}$ becomes a ring again in a canonical way.
	
	For $B_I$ the situation is a bit different, since there is no single topology on $B^b$, but one for every valuation $v_r$ (and in fact these are incompatible for different values of $r$).  In this case we take the family $\Ff=\left\{\bigcap_{i=1}^nv_{r_i}^{-1}[m,\infty)\st m,n\in\IN\text{ and }r_i\in I\right\}$ and then define
	\begin{equation*}
		B_I=\limit_{U\in \Ff}B^b/U
	\end{equation*}
	as above. In the case where $I=[a,b]$ is compact, this is indeed the \enquote{smallest} ring in which all sequences that are Cauchy with respect to every $r\in I$ are convergent. Indeed, every $r\in I$ can be written as $r=\lambda a+(1-\lambda)b$ for $0\leq \lambda\leq 1$, and if $v_a(f),v_b(f)\geq m$, then also $v_r(f)\geq \lambda m+(1-\lambda)m=m$. For non-compact $I$, the situation is not that easy, but at least the above construction shows
	\begin{equation*}
		B_I=\limit_{J\subseteq I}B_J\,,
	\end{equation*}
	where the limit is taken over all compact subintervalls of $J\subseteq I$. In particular, this applies to the most important special case $I=(0,\infty)$.

	As already remarked in \cref{rem:Y}, there is an adic analogue of the Fargues--Fontaine curve: put $\Yy=\Spf(\IA_\inf)^\mathrm{ad}\setminus V(\pi[\varpi])$ and let $\Xx=\Yy/\phi^\IZ$. Then $B\cong \Global(\Yy,\Oo_\Yy)$.

	One can show that $\pi^{-1}\colon \phi^*\Oo_\Yy\isomorphism \Oo_\Yy$ defines the descent datum for a line bundle $\Oo(1)$ on $\Xx$. Moreover, one has
	\begin{equation*}
		H^0\big(\Xx,\Oo(1)^{\otimes d}\big)\cong B^{(\pi^{-1}\phi)^d=1}=B^{\phi=\pi^d}\,.

The goal of the next few lectures is to understand the scheme $X_\FFC$, and in particular the rings $B$ and $B^b$. We start with a lemma that essentially says that the eigenspaces of $\phi$ on $B^b$, i.e., before completion, are rather boring.
\begin{lem}
	For $d\in\IZ$ let $(B^b)^{\phi=\pi^d}\subseteq B^b$ be the eigenspace of $\phi$ with respect to the eigenvalue $\pi^d$. Then
	\begin{equation*}
		(B^b)^{\phi=\pi^d}=\begin{cases}
			E & \text{if }d=0\\
			0 & \text{else}
		\end{cases}\,.
	\end{equation*}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
	For $d=0$, let $f=\sum_{i\gge -\infty}^\infty [x_i]\pi^i\in B^b$. If $f$ is fixed under $\phi$, then $\phi(x_i)=x_i$ for all $i$, hence $x_i\in\IF_q\subseteq \Oo_F$. This shows $f\in W_{\Oo_E}(\IF_q)\big[\frac 1\pi\big]\cong E$. The converse can be shown in the same way.
	Now let $d\neq 0$. If $f\in (B^b)^{\phi=\pi^d}$ and $x\in \IR$, then 
	\begin{equation*}
		q\Newt(f)(x)=\Newt(\phi(f))(x)=\Newt(\pi^d f)(x)=\Newt (f)(x-d)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Iterating gives $q^n\Newt(f)(x)=\Newt(f)(x-dn)$ for all $n\geq 1$. For $d>0$, we have $\Newt(f)(x-dn)=+\infty$ for $n\gge 0$, hence already $\Newt(f)(x)=+\infty$. This implies $f=0$. For $d<0$ pick $x_0\gge 0$ with $\Newt(f)(x_0)=+\infty$. Since $\Newt(f)$ is decreasing, for all $x\in\IR$ there exists an $n$ such that $\Newt(f)\geq \Newt(x_0-nd)=q^n\Newt(f)(x_0)=+\infty$. Thus $f=0$ follows as before. 
\end{proof}
\begin{lem}\label{lem:convergeInB}
	Let $(x_n)_{n\in\IZ}$ be a sequence in $F$ such that $\lim_{|n|\to\infty}v(x_n)+rn=\infty$ for all $r\in(0,\infty)$. Then $\sum_{n\in\IZ}[x_n]\pi^n$ converges in $B$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
	It suffices to show that $v_r([x_n]\pi^n)\to\infty$ as $|n|\to\infty$ for all $r\in(0,\infty)$. But $v_r([x_n]\pi^n)=v(x_n)+rn$, so this holds by assumption.
\end{proof}
\begin{rem}
	\begin{numerate}
		\item For all $a\in \mm_F$, the sequence $f_a\coloneqq \sum_{i\in\IZ}[a^{q^{-i}}]\pi^i$ coverges in $B$, and $f_a\in B^{\phi=\pi}$. To prove this we need to check $q^{-i}v(a)+ri=v(a^{q^{-i}})+ri\to \infty$ as $|i|\to\infty$ for all $r\in(0,\infty)$, using \cref{lem:convergeInB}. This is clear as $v(a)>0$. Also one immediately checks $\phi(f_a)=\pi f_a$, hence indeed $f_a\in B^{\phi=d}$. In fact, we will prove later that the above construction gives a bijection $\mm_F\cong B^{\phi=\pi}$. This should seem a bit weird at first since the right-hand side $B^{\phi=\pi}$ is an $E$-vector space, so the left-hand side better be one as well. One can indeed construct a $E$-vector space structure on $\mm_F$ by Lubin--Tate theory.
		\item In general, it is not known whether elements in $B$ can be written as $\sum_{n\in\IZ}[x_n]\pi^n$ for $[x_n]\in F$. So we need different tools to study $B$.
	\end{numerate}
\end{rem}
The goal for the next few lectures is to prove that $X=X_\FFC$ is indeed a curve.
\begin{thm}[Fargues--Fontaine]\label{thm:FFCisACurve}
	The Fargues--Fontaine curve $X_\FFC$ is a Dedekind scheme. More precisely, for each $t\in B^{\phi=\pi}$, the open subset $D_+(t)\cong \Spec B\big[\frac 1t\big]^{\phi=1}$ is the spectrum of a principal ideal domain.
\end{thm}
To prove \cref{thm:FFCisACurve} we need Newton polygons for elements in $B_I$, where $I\subseteq (0,\infty)$ is an ideal. Note that for all $r\in I$, the valuation $v_r\colon B^b\morphism \IR\cup\{\infty\}$ extends to $B_I$ by continuity.
\begin{defi}\label{def:NewtOpen}
	Assume $I\subseteq (0,\infty)$ is an open intervall, and $f\in B_I$. Let $\Newt_I^0(f)$ be the decreasing convex function whose Legendre transform is
	\begin{equation*}
		\Ll\Newt_I^0(f)(r)=\begin{cases}
		v_r(f) & \text{if }r\in I\\
		-\infty & \text{else}
		\end{cases}\,.
	\end{equation*}
	The \defemph{Newton polygon $\Newt_I(f)\subseteq \IR^2$} is the subset of the graph of $\Newt_I^0(f)$ with slopes in $-I$.
\end{defi}
\begin{rem}
	If $K\subseteq I$ is compact and $(f_n)_{n\in\IN}$ a sequence in $B^b$ converging to $f\neq 0$, then there exists an $N$ such that for all $n\geq N$ we have $v_r(f_n)=v_r(f)$ for all $r\in K$. In particular, $\Ll\Newt_I^0(f)$ is a concave piece-wise linear function with integral slopes. Thus, $\Newt_I^0(f)$ is a decreasing convex polygon with integral breakpoints.
\end{rem}
\begin{rem}
	\begin{numerate}
		\item If $a\in\mm_F$ and $f_a$ is as above, then $\Newt_{(0,\infty)}(f_a)$ is a \enquote{polygon version} of the exponential function $i\mapsto v(a)q^{-i}$:
		\begin{center}

			\draw (-3,0.75ex) -- (-3,-0.75ex) node[below] {$-3$};
			\end{tikzpicture}
		\end{center}
		Note that there is no $x\in\IR$ where $\Newt_{(0,\infty)}(f_a)(x)=+\infty$.
		\item If $f\in B$ and $\lambda_i$ is the slope of $\Newt_{(0,\infty)}(f)$ on $[i,i+1]$, then
		\begin{equation*}
			\lambda_i\leq 0\,,\quad\lim_{i\to\infty}\lambda_i=0\,,\quad\text{and}\lim_{i\to-\infty}\lambda_i=-\infty\,.
		\end{equation*}
	\end{numerate}
\end{rem}
So far we have defined Newton polygons for open intervalls $I$. In the case of compact intervalls $I=[a,b]$, the above \cref{def:NewtOpen} doesn't work any more and we need slightly more complicated one.
\begin{defi}
	Let $I=[a,b]$ be a compact intervall and $0\neq f\in B_I$. We define $\Newt_I^0(f)$ to be the decreasing convex function whose Legendre transform is
	\begin{equation*}
		\Ll\Newt_I^0(f)(r)=\begin{cases}
		v_r(f) & \text{if }r\in I\\
		-\infty & \text{if }r<0\\
		v_a(f)+(r-a)\partial_-v_a(f) & \text{if }r<a\\
		v_b(f)+(r-b)\partial_+v_b(f) & \text{if }r\geq b
		\end{cases}\,,
	\end{equation*}
	and again $\Newt_I(f)\subseteq \IR$ is the subset of the graph of $\Newt_I^0(f)$ with slopes in $-I$.
\end{defi}
\begin{rem}
	\begin{numerate}
		\item If $(f_n)_{n\in\IN}$ is a sequence in $B^b$ converging to $f$, then
		\begin{equation*}
			\partial_+v_r(f)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\partial_+v_r(f_n)\quad\text{and}\quad\partial_-v_r(f)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\partial_-v_r(f_n)\,.
		\end{equation*}
		Here $\partial_+v_r(f)$ denotes the right-derivative of the function $s\mapsto v_s(f)$ at $s=r$. Likewise $\partial_-$ denotes left-derivatives.
		\item For $f\in B^b$ and $\lambda$ a slope of $\Newt(f)$, then $\partial_+v_r(f)-\partial_-v_r(f)$ is precisely the multiplicity of $\lambda$ in $\Newt(f)$.
