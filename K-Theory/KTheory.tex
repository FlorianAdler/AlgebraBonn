\chapter{Symmetric Monoidal \texorpdfstring{$\infty$}{infty}-Categories and \texorpdfstring{$\IE_\infty$}{Einfty}-Spaces}\setcounter{dummy}{-1}
We start things off slowly by only considering (not necessarily symmetric) monoidal $\infty$-categories and $\IE_1$-spaces.
\numpar{Stasheff's Definition of Coherently Associative Monoids}
The naive way to define a monoid in $\An$ would be to have an object $M\in \An$ together with a multiplication map
\begin{equation*}
	\mu\colon M\times M\morphism M\,.
\end{equation*}
Now $\mu$ induces two different maps $M^3\morphism M$ (\enquote{two ways of bracketing}), so there ought to be a homotopy $H\colon \mu\circ (\mu\times \id_M)\simeq \mu\circ(\id_M\times \mu)$ between them. But then there are five maps $M^4\morphism M$ (\enquote{five ways of bracketing}), and we see that $H$ induces a loop in $\Hom_\An(M^4,M)$. Since $M$ should be associative up to \emph{coherent homotopy}, this loop has to be filled. The story goes on: There are a number of maps $M^5\morphism M$ (too lazy to count them) and now there are some $3$-simplices to be filled and so on.

Although this looks horrible, it is possible to turn these considerations into a precise definition, and one obtains Stasheff's \emph{$\IA_\infty$-spaces}. But we can take a simpler route! Indeed, thanks to our efforts so far, we now have the luxury of saying: \enquote{Well, a coherently associative monoid is just an $\infty$ category with only one object.} This leads to the following definition.
\begin{defi}\label{def:CartesianMonoids}
	Let $\Cc$ be an $\infty$-category with finite products (in particular, $\Cc$ has a final object $*\in \Cc$). A \emph{cartesian monoid in $\Cc$} is a functor $X\colon \IDelta^\op\morphism \Cc$ such that:
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item $X_0\simeq *$.
		\item It satisfies the Segal condition, i.e., the Segal maps $e_i\colon [1]\morphism {[n]}$ define an equivalence
		\begin{equation*}
			X_n\isomorphism \prod_{i=1}^nX_1
		\end{equation*}
	\end{alphanumerate}
	Let $\cat{Mon}(\Cc)\subseteq\cat{s}\Cc$ be the full sub-$\infty$-category spanned by cartesian monoids. If $\Cc=\An$, these are also called \emph{$\IE_1$-spaces}, \emph{$\IA_\infty$-spaces}, \emph{coherent monoids}, \emph{special $\Delta$-spaces}, \dotso. For $\Cc=\Cat_\infty$ we simply call them \emph{monoidal $\infty$-categories} (note that these can also be encoded as cocartesian fibrations over $\IDelta^\op$).
\end{defi}
To make sense of the condition from \cref{def:CartesianMonoids}\itememph{b}, note that since $X_0\simeq *$ is terminal, we have $X_1\times_{X_0}\times\dotsb\times_{X_0}X_1\simeq \prod_{i=1}^nX_1$, so this condition really \emph{is} the Segal condition. Somewhat weird though is that we don't impose any completeness conditions, and in fact, cartesian monoids in $\An$ are usually \emph{not} complete Segal spaces! This is in some sense fixed by the following proposition.
\begin{prop}\label{prop:CompletionOfMonoidsFullyFaithful}
	The completion functor $\comp\colon\cat{sAn}\morphism\cat{CSAn}$ from Lemma/Defi-nition~\labelcref{lemdef:Completion} restricts to a fully faithful functor
	\begin{equation*}
		\comp\colon\cat{Mon}(\An)\morphism */\cat{CSAn}
	\end{equation*}
	with essential image those pointed complete segal spaces $(X,x)$ with $\pi_0X_0=*$.
\end{prop}
In other words, monoids really are categories with one object (up to equivalence, but not up to contractible choice, as Bastiaan pointed out in the lecture), since the target is also pointed categories with connected base.
\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{prop:CompletionOfMonoidsFullyFaithful}]
	\emph{Step~1.} Let's construct a candidate for an inverse functor. Recall that if $X$ is Segal, then the completion functor does not affect the pullback spaces
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			P_{x,y}\rar\dar\drar[pullback] & X_1\dar["{(d_1,d_0)}"]\\
			*\rar["{(x,y)}"] & X_0\times X_0
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	(this follows essentially from \cref{eq:asscat2}). This motivates the following definition of an inverse (\enquote{decompletion}) functor $\decomp\colon */\cat{CSAn}\morphism \cat{Mon}(\An)$: Let $(X,x)$ be a pointed complete Segal space. We send it to $Y\in \cat{Mon}(\An)$, where $Y\colon \IDelta^\op\morphism \An$ is defined by the pullback
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large]
			Y_n\dar\rar\drar[pullback]& X_n\dar\\
			*\rar["{(x,\dotsc,x)}"] & X_0^{n+1}
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	for all $[n]\in \IDelta^\op$. Let's first address the elephant in the room, i.e.\ how to make the pointwise-defined $Y_n$ into a functor $\IDelta^\op\morphism \An$, which in turn should be functorial in $X$. We'll have solved both problems at once if we show that the diagram
	$*\morphism X_0^{n+1}\lmorphism X_n$ is functorial in $(X,x)$ and in $[n]$. To this end consider $X$ as a functor $\IDelta\morphism \An^\op$ and colimit-extend it to a functor
	\begin{equation*}
		|\blank|_X\colon \cat{sAn}\morphism \An^\op\,.
	\end{equation*}
	This can be done functorially in $X$, as \cref{thm:ColimitPreservingRepresentable} shows. In more abstract terms, what we do here is to identify  $\cat{sAn}\simeq \Fun(\IDelta,\An^\op)^\op\simeq \Fun^L(\cat{sAn},\An^\op)^\op$. We define two functors $\Delta,\Delta_0\colon \IDelta\morphism\cat{sSet}\subseteq\cat{sAn}$ via $\Delta([n])=\Delta^n$ and $\Delta_0([n])=\coprod_{i=0}^n\Delta^0$. Since $\Delta$ and $\Delta_0$ are functors between $1$-categories (before we compose them with the inclusion $\cat{sSet}\subseteq \cat{sAn}$), we don't need to check any higher coherences and immediately obtain that $\Delta$ and $\Delta_0$ are indeed functors. Moreover, the canonical map $\coprod_{i=0}^n\Delta^0\morphism \Delta^n$ sending the $i\ordinalth$ component to the $i\ordinalth$ vertex of $\Delta^n$ is clearly functorial in $[n]\in \IDelta$, hence it induces a natural transformation $\Delta_0\Rightarrow\Delta$ (which exhibits $\Delta_0$ as the \enquote{$0$-skeleton} of $\Delta$, hence the notation).
	
	Now consider the two composites
	\begin{equation*}
		\cat{sAn}\simeq \Fun\left(\IDelta,\An^\op\right)^\op\simeq \Fun\left(\cat{sAn},\An^\op\right)^\op\doublemorphism[\Delta^*][\Delta_0^*]\Fun\left(\IDelta,\An^\op\right)^\op\simeq \cat{sAn}\,,
	\end{equation*}
	which we denote $|\Delta|_{(-)}$ and $|\Delta_0|_{(-)}$. The transformation $\Delta_0\Rightarrow \Delta$ induces a transformation $|\Delta|_{(-)}\Rightarrow |\Delta_0|_{(-)}$ (since there has been an $(-)^\op$ in between). Upon closer inspection, we find that $\Delta\colon \IDelta\morphism\cat{sAn}$ is actually nothing else but the Yoneda embedding, hence \cref{thm:ColimitPreservingRepresentable} shows that $|\Delta|_{(-)}\simeq \id$! Moreover, since $|\blank|_X$ preserves colimits, we easily obtain
	\begin{equation*}
		X_0^{n+1}\simeq \left|\coprod_{i=0}^n\Delta^0\right|_X\,,
	\end{equation*}
	hence the $X_0^{n+1}$ can be organized into a simplicial anima $|\Delta_0|_X$. The transformation $\id\simeq |\Delta|_{(-)}\Rightarrow |\Delta_0|_{(-)}$ gives a natural map $X\morphism |\Delta_0|_X$.
	
	This shows that the maps $X_0^{n+1}\lmorphism X_n$ can indeed be made functorial in $X$ and $[n]$. A similar argument applies shows that the maps $*\morphism X_0^{n+1}$, which assemble into a functorial map $\Delta^0\morphism |\Delta_0|_X$. We conclude that $Y\simeq X\times_{|\Delta_0|_X}\Delta^0$ as above is indeed a simplicial anima and functorial in $X$. We have $Y_0\simeq *$ by construction and also $Y_n\simeq Y_1\times_{Y_0}\dotsb\times_{Y_0}Y_1$ follows from the fact that $X$ itself satisfies the Segal conditions together with some abstract pullback nonsense (basically that \enquote{limits commute}, see the dual of \cref{prop:ColimitsCommute}). So $Y\in \cat{Mon}(\An)$ and we can finally write down the functor
	\begin{equation*}
		\decomp\colon */\cat{CSAn}\morphism \cat{Mon}(\An)\,.
	\end{equation*}

	\emph{Step~2.} Next, let's check that $\comp\colon \cat{Mon}(\An)\morphism \cat{CSAn}$ from \cref{lemdef:Completion} indeed factors over $*/\cat{CSAn}\morphism \cat{CSAn}$ and that its essential image is contained in those pointed complete Segal spaces $(X,x)$ with $\pi_0X_0=*$. To get the factorization, observe that $\cat{Mon}(\An)$ has an initial object, namely $\Delta^0\in\sSet\subseteq\cat{sAn}$ (in the lecture we called it \enquote{$\const*$}, but it's really just $\Delta^0$). Indeed, if $T\in \cat{Mon}(\An)$, then
	\begin{equation*}
		\Hom_{\cat{Mon}(\An)}(\Delta^0,T)\simeq \Hom_{\cat{sAn}}(\Delta^0,T)\simeq T_0\simeq *
	\end{equation*}
	by \cref{def:CartesianMonoids}\itememph{a}. Also $\comp (\Delta^0)\simeq *$, so the completion functor really lifts to a functor $\cat{Mon}(\An)\simeq \Delta^0/\cat{Mon}(\An)\morphism */\cat{CSAn}$, as required.
	
	To check that $\pi_0(\comp T)_0=*$, recall that $(\comp T)_0\simeq \core \asscat T\simeq |T^\times|$ by \cref{eq:asscat1}. Now we have to use the following general fact:
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item[\itememph{*}] \itshape For all $X\in\cat{sAn}$ the map $\pi_0X_0\morphism \pi_0|X|$ is surjective.
	\end{alphanumerate}
	This shows what we want since $(T^\times)_0\simeq T_0\simeq *$ holds by assumption. To see where \itememph{*} comes from, observe that $\pi_0$, being a left adjoint (\cref{exm:MyFirstAdjoints}\itememph{a}), commutes with colimits. This shows $\pi_0|X|\simeq \pi_0\colimit_{\IDelta^\op}X\simeq \colimit_{\IDelta^\op}\pi_0X$, where the colimit on the right-hand side is a good old colimit taken in $\sSet$. Now $\{d_0,d_1\colon [1]\shortdoublemorphism [0]\}\subseteq \IDelta^\op$ is $1$-cofinal (but not $\infty$-cofinal!), hence
	\begin{equation*}
		\colimit_{\IDelta^\op}\pi_0X=\Coeq\left(\pi_0X_1\doublemorphism[d_1][d_0] \pi_0X_0\right)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	This immediately implies \itememph{*}.
	
	\emph{Step~3.} Finally, we check that $\decomp\colon (*/\cat{CSAn})_{\pi_0=*}\morphism \cat{Mon}(\An)$ is indeed an inverse, where $(*/\cat{CSAn})_{\pi_0=*}\subseteq */\cat{CSAn}$ is the full subcategory spanned by those $(X,x)$ with $\pi_0X_0=*$. The first step is to construct the required natural transformations. We didn't do this in the lecture (Fabian promised to give a full proof in the lecture notes soon), so here's what I would do. We claim:
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item[\itememph{\boxtimes}]\itshape The functors $\comp\colon \cat{Mon}(\An)\shortdoublelrmorphism */\cat{CSAn}\noloc \decomp$ form an adjunction.
	\end{alphanumerate}
	Once we proved \itememph{\boxtimes}, we get the required transformations for free. So let's do this! Consider $T\in \cat{Mon}(\An)$, which is naturally pointed via the unique (up to contractible choice) map $1_T\colon \Delta^0\morphism T$, and let $(X,x)$ be a pointed complete Segal space. Then
	\begin{align*}
		\Hom_{*/\cat{CSAn}}\big(\comp T,(X,x)\big)&\simeq \Hom_{*/\cat{sAn}}\big((T,1_T),(X,x)\big)\\
		&\simeq \Hom_{\cat{sAn}}(T,X)\times_{\Hom_{\cat{sAn}}(\const 1_T,X)}\{\const x\}\\
		&\simeq \Hom_{\cat{sAn}}(T,X)\times_{\Hom_\An(1_T,X_0)}\{x\}\,.
	\end{align*}
	The first equivalence follows from \cref{lemdef:Completion} (and the fact that adjunctions extend to slice categories), the second follows from \cite[Corollary~VIII.6]{HigherCatsII}. The last one follows by inspection. All of them are functorial in $(X,x)$. Moreover, we have
	\begin{align*}
		\Hom_{\cat{Mon}(\An)}\big(T,\decomp (X,x)\big)&\simeq \Hom_{\cat{sAn}}\left(T,X\times_{|\Delta_0|_X}\Delta^0\right)\\
		&\simeq \Hom_{\cat{sAn}}(T,X)\times_{\Hom_{\cat{sAn}}(T,|\Delta_0|_X)}\Hom_{\cat{sAn}}(T,\Delta^0)\,.
	\end{align*}
	Since $\id\Rightarrow |\Delta_0|_{(-)}$ is a natural transformation, one quickly checks that the morphism $\Hom_{\cat{sAn}}(T,X)\morphism \Hom_{\cat{sAn}}(T,|\Delta_0|_X)$ factors over $\Hom_{\cat{sAn}}(|\Delta_0|_T,|\Delta_0|_X)$. But $T_0\simeq *$, hence $|\Delta_0|_T\simeq \Delta^0$. Also $\Hom_{\cat{sAn}}(T,\Delta^0)\simeq *$. Putting everything together, we can rewrite
	\begin{equation*}
		\Hom_{\cat{Mon}(\An)}\big(T,\decomp (X,x)\big)\simeq \Hom_{\cat{sAn}}(T,X)\times_{\Hom_\An(T_0,X_0)}\{x\}\,,
	\end{equation*} 
	and after another inspection, this provides the required natural equivalence
	\begin{equation*}
		\Hom_{*/\cat{CSAn}}\big(\comp T,(X,x)\big)\simeq\Hom_{\cat{Mon}(\An)}\big(T,\decomp (X,x)\big)\,,
	\end{equation*}
	proving \itememph{\boxtimes}.
	
	Equipped with our newly-acquired unit and counit transformations $\id\Rightarrow \decomp\circ \comp$ and $\comp\circ\decomp\Rightarrow \id$, we now set out to prove that $\decomp\colon (*/\cat{CSAn})_{\pi_0=*}\morphism \cat{Mon}(\An)$ is indeed an inverse of $\comp$. Let's start with the second one, i.e.\ the counit. We must show $\comp(\decomp (X,x))\simeq (X,x)$ for all $(X,x)\in (*/\cat{CSAn})_{\pi_0=*}$ . Observe that $\comp X\simeq X$ because $X$ is already complete. Hence it suffices to show $\asscat(\decomp(X,x))\simeq \asscat X$ (and check that the chosen base points on both sides correspond, but that's easy) because $\N^r$ is fully faithful by \cref{thmdef:RezkNerve}. Using \cref{eq:asscat1} and the fact that $X^\times$ is a constant simplicial anima with value $X_0$ as $X$ is complete, we see that
	\begin{equation*}
		\pi_0\core(\asscat X)\simeq \pi_0|X^\times|\simeq \pi_0X_0\simeq *\,,
	\end{equation*}
	so $\asscat(\decomp(X,x))\morphism \asscat X$ is essentially surjective for trivial reasons. Moreover, we have $\decomp(X,x)_0\simeq \{x\}$ by construction, and \cref{eq:asscat2} (which is applicable here because $\decomp(X,x)$ is Segal by construction) easily shows
	\begin{equation*}
		\Hom_{\asscat(\decomp(X,x))}(x,x)\simeq P_{x,x}\simeq \Hom_{\asscat X}(x,x)\,,
	\end{equation*}
	so $\asscat(\decomp(X,x))\morphism \asscat(X)$ is fully faithful too. This shows that the counit is an equivalence, as claimed.
	
	The argument for the unit is similar: We have to show $T\simeq \decomp(\comp T)$ for all $T\in \cat{Mon}(\An)$. Since both sides are functors $\IDelta^\op\morphism \cat{An}$ and a natural transformation between them is already given, we can do this degree-wise by \cref{thm:JoyalEquivalence}\itememph{b}. Since both sides are cartesian monoids, is suffices to check that the map in degree $1$ is an equivalence, i.e.\ that $T_1\simeq \decomp(\comp T)_1$. Write $(X,x)\simeq \comp T$. By construction we have
	\begin{equation*}
		\decomp(X,x)_1\simeq P_{x,x}\quad\text{and}\quad T_1\simeq P_{1_T,1_T}\,,
	\end{equation*}
	where as usual $1_T\colon \Delta^0\morphism T$ is the natural pointing of $T$. As observed at the very beginning of this proof, the spaces $P_{y,z}$ aren't affected by completion, hence $P_{x,x}\simeq P_{1_T,1_T}$ and we're done. 
\end{proof}
\lecture[More on $\IE_1$-monoids and $\IE_1$-groups. Group completion.\newline --- \enquote{\emph{The fact that you can write down a group or a monoid in semester 2 is sort of an accident.}}]{2020-11-26}Under the equivalence $\Cat_\infty\simeq \cat{CSAn}$ from \cref{thmdef:RezkNerve}, the construction of $\decomp$ from the proof of \cref{prop:CompletionOfMonoidsFullyFaithful} corresponds to a functor $*/\Cat_\infty\morphism\cat{Mon}(\An)$ which becomes an equivalence when restricted to the full subcategory $(*/\Cat_\infty)_{\geq 1}\subseteq */\Cat_\infty$ spanned by those $\Cc$ with $\pi_0\core\Cc\simeq *$. In diagrams,
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}
		*/\Cat_\infty\rar & \cat{Mon}(\An)\\
		(*/\Cat_\infty)_{\geq 1}\uar[symbol=\subseteq]\urar[iso] & 
	\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
Explicitly, this functor sends a pointed $\infty$-category $(\{x\}\morphism \Cc)$ to $\Hom_\Cc(x,x)$ in degree $1$ (and then all other degrees are determined by the conditions from \cref{def:CartesianMonoids}). We thus obtain:
\begin{cor}
	If $\Cc$ is an $\infty$-category and $x\in \Cc$, then $\Hom_\Cc(x,x)$ carries a canonical structure of an $\IE_1$-monoid.
\end{cor}
\begin{defi}\label{def:E1Group}
	Let $\Cc$ be an $\infty$-category with finite products. A cartesian monoid $X$ in $\Cc$ is called a \emph{cartesian group} (or \emph{$\IE_1$-group} in the case $\Cc=\An$) if the map
	\begin{align*}
		(\pr_1,\circ)\colon X_1\times X_1&\isomorphism X_1\times X_1\\
		(f,g)&\longmapsto (f,f\circ g)
	\end{align*}
	is an equivalence. Here \enquote{$\circ$} is the composition as defined in \cref{thmdef:RezkNerve}\itememph{c}. We denote by $\Grp(\Cc)\subseteq \cat{Mon}(\Cc)$ the full sub-$\infty$-category of cartesian groups.
\end{defi}
\begin{prop}\label{prop:Grp(An)=(*/An)Connected}
	The equivalences $\cat{Mon}(\An)\simeq (*/\Cat_\infty)\simeq (*/\cat{CSAn})_{\pi_0=*}$ restrict to equivalences
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=small]
			\cat{Mon}(\An)\dar[iso]\rar[symbol=\supseteq] & \Grp(\An)\dar[iso]\\
			(*/\Cat_\infty)_{\geq 1}\dar[iso] \rar[symbol=\supseteq] & (*/\An)_{\geq 1}\dar[iso]\\
			(*/\cat{CSAn})_{\pi_0=*}\rar[symbol=\supseteq] & (*/\mathrm{const.}\ \cat{sAn})_{\pi_0=*}
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	In the lower right corner we use the notation from \cref{exm:MyFirstRezkNerves}\itememph{c}.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
	In the lecture we noted only that $X\in \cat{Mon}(\An)$ is an $\IE_1$-group iff the set $\pi_0X_1$ with its induced ordinary monoid structure is an ordinary group.
	
	To elaborate on this a bit more, first note that we may assume $X\simeq \Hom_\Cc(x,x)$ for some $\infty$-category $\Cc$ with $\pi_0\core \Cc\simeq *$, as was argued above. If $X$ is an $\IE_1$-group, then $\pi_0\Hom_\Cc(x,x)$ must be an ordinary group, which implies that all endomorphisms of $x$ are equivalences, hence all morphisms in $\Cc$ are equivalences as $\pi_0\core \Cc\simeq *$. This proves that $\Cc$ is an anima by \cref{thm:JoyalLifting}. Conversely, if $\Cc$ is an anima, either inclusion $[1]\monomorphism J$ into the free-living isomorphism induces a trivial fibration $\Fun(J,\Cc)\isomorphism \Ar(\Cc)$. Choosing a section and composing it with the the other map $\Fun(J,\Cc)\morphism \Ar(\Cc)$ (induced by the other inclusion $[1]\monomorphism J$) yields an \enquote{inversion} map $(-)^{-1}\colon \Hom_\Cc(x,x)\morphism \Hom_\Cc(x,x)$. From this we can construct an inverse of the map in \cref{def:E1Group}
\end{proof}
\numpar{}\label{par:Grp(An)=(*/An)Connected}
The equivalence $\Grp(\An)\simeq (*/\An)_{\geq 1}$ is explicitly given as follows:
\begin{equation*}
	|\blank|\colon \Grp(\An)\doublelrmorphism[\sim][\sim](*/\An)_{\geq 1}\noloc \Omega
\end{equation*}
(sometimes the functor $|\blank| = \colimit_{\IDelta^\op}$ is also denoted \enquote{$B$} for \enquote{Bar construction}, but Fabian doesn't like that). To make sense of this, recall that the composition
\begin{equation*}
	\cat{Mon}(\An)\xrightarrow{\comp}\cat{CSAn}\morphism[\ev_0]\An
\end{equation*}
sends $X\mapsto |X^\times|$, as follows from \cref{eq:asscat1} and some unravelling. If $X$ is an $\IE_1$-group, one easily verifies $X^\times=X$ and thus $X\in \Grp(\An)$ is sent to $|X|$, as claimed above. Conversely, the composition
\begin{equation*}
	(*/\An)_{\geq 1}\xrightarrow{\decomp}\Grp(\An)\morphism[\ev_1]\An
\end{equation*}
sends a pointed connected anima $(K,k)$ to $\Hom_K(k,k)$, as argued previously. So to justify why $(*/\An)_{\geq 1}\isomorphism \Grp(\An)$ should be thought of as a \enquote{loop space functor}, we must explain why $\Omega_kK\simeq \Hom_K(k,k)$. This can be done by several arguments and I will present a different one than in the lecture. The loop space is usually defined by the left of the following pullback diagrams in $\An$:
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}
		\Omega_kK\vphantom{\Hom_K^L}\dar\rar\drar[pullback]& *\vphantom{K_{k/}}\dar["k"]\\
		*\rar["k"] & K
	\end{tikzcd}\quad\isomorphism\quad
	\begin{tikzcd}
		\Hom_K^L(k,k)\dar\rar\drar[pullback]& K_{k/}\dar\\
		*\rar["k"]& K
	\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
The map $*\morphism K$ can be factored into the left anodyne map $*\monomorphism K_{k/}$ followed by the left fibration $K_{k/}\morphism K$, which is even a Kan fibration since $K$ is an anima. Replacing one of the $*\morphism K$ accordingly, we obtain the pullback diagram on the right, which is already a pullback in $\sSet$ as one leg is a Kan fibration (see \cref{thm:HomotopyLimits}). Its pullback is thus $\Hom_K^L(k,k)\simeq \Hom_K(k,k)$ as left-$\Hom$ anima coincide with the regular $\Hom$ anima by \cite[Digression~I Corollary~D.2]{HigherCatsII}.

In particular, we have proved another result from algebraic topology (or rather deduced it from the much more general statement of \cref{thmdef:RezkNerve}, which we didn't prove, but never mind that).
\begin{cor}[Recognition Principle for Loop Spaces, Stasheff]
	The loop functor $\Omega\colon */\An\morphism \An$ lifts to an equivalence
	\begin{equation*}
		\Omega\colon (*/\An)_{\geq 1}\isomorphism \Grp(\An)\,.
	\end{equation*}
\end{cor}
Note that $\ev_1\colon \cat{Mon}(\An)\morphism \An$ preserves limits since $\cat{Mon}(\An)$ is closed under limits in $\cat{sAn}$ (the Segal condition is given by a limit and limits commute by the dual of \cref{prop:ColimitsCommute}). Colimits however are bloody complicated, and even though one can show that $\cat{Mon}(\An)$ is cocomplete, colimits in it are \emph{by far not} just colimits of underlying simplicial anima, same as colimits of ordinary monoids are much more complicated than colimits in sets.
\begin{prop}\label{prop:InftyGrp}
	The inclusion $\Grp(\An)\subseteq\cat{Mon}(\An)$ has a left adjoint called \emph{group completion} and denoted
	\begin{equation*}
		(-)^\inftygrp\colon \cat{Mon}(\An)\morphism \Grp(\An)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	It is given by $X^\inftygrp\simeq \Omega_e|X|$ \embrace{often also denoted $\Omega BX$}.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	We know that $\An\subseteq \Cat_\infty$ has a left-adjoint $|\blank|\colon \Cat_\infty\morphism \An$. By the usual abstract adjunction nonsense, this extends to a left adjoint
	\begin{equation*}
		|\blank|\colon (*/\Cat_\infty)_{\geq 1}\morphism (*/\An)_{\geq 1}\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Now use \cref{prop:Grp(An)=(*/An)Connected} to get the desired left-adjoint $(-)^\inftygrp\colon \cat{Mon}(\An)\morphism\Grp(\An)$. The explicit description follows from our calculations in \cref{par:Grp(An)=(*/An)Connected}
\end{proof}
Next we will discuss some examples. We begin with free monoids and groups.
\begin{prop}\label{prop:FreeMonoids}
	The evaluation functor $\ev_1\colon \cat{Mon}(\An)\morphism \An$ has a left adjoint $\operatorname{Free}^{\IE_1}\colon \An\morphism \cat{Mon}(\An)$. It is given explicitly by the \enquote{anima of words of arbitrary length}
	\begin{equation*}
		\operatorname{Free}^{\IE_1}(K)_1\simeq \coprod_{n\geq 0}K^n\,.
	\end{equation*}
\end{prop}
We postpone the proof of \cref{prop:FreeMonoids}. By the explicit construction given there, the diagram
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}
		\Set\dar\rar["\operatorname{Free}"]& \cat{Mon}(\Set)\dar\\
		\An\rar["\operatorname{Free}^{\IE_1}"] & \cat{Mon}(\An)
	\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
commutes. But be aware that this is not automatic, and in fact we'll see it very much breaks once we impose commutativity. As some first examples, one has $\operatorname{Free}^{\IE_1}(*)\simeq\IN$ and $\operatorname{Free}^{\IE_1}(\emptyset)\simeq *$, which is initial in $\cat{Mon}(\An)$.
\begin{prop}\label{prop:FreeGroups}
	The evaluation functor $\ev_1\colon \Grp(\An)\morphism \An$ has a left-adjoint too. Explicitly, it is given by the composite
	\begin{align*}
		\An&\morphism */\An\morphism[\Sigma]*/\An\morphism[\Omega]\Grp(\An)\\
		X&\longmapsto X\sqcup *\,.
	\end{align*}
	In other words, the free $\IE_1$-group on $X$ is $\Omega\Sigma X_+$, where $X_+=X\sqcup *$. As usual, the suspension functor $\Sigma\colon \An\morphism \An$ is given by the pushout diagram
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			X\dar\rar\drar[pushout] & *\dar\\
			* \rar& \Sigma X
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
\end{prop}
\begin{rem*}\label{rem*:CoLimitsIn(*/An)OrAn}
	For the proof, we'll need a functor $\Sigma\colon */\An\morphism */\An$ instead. It is induced by its unpointed variant, of course, but we can also define it by taking the above pushout in $*/\An$. In fact, it doesn't matter whether the pushout is taken in $*/\An$ or $\An$ since $*/\An\morphism \An$ commutes with weakly contractible colimits (but not with arbitrary ones, as I claimed before; for example, it doesn't preserve the initial object). Indeed, if $\Ii$ is any diagram shape, then a quick calculation shows $\Fun(\Ii,*/\An)\simeq (\const *)/\Fun(\Ii,\An)$. For the adjunction 
	\begin{equation*}
		\colimit_\Ii\colon \Fun(\Ii,\An)\doublelrmorphism\An\noloc \const
	\end{equation*}
	to descend to slice categories below $\const*$ and $*$, we need that these objects are mapped to each other and that unit/counit are equivalences on them. If $\Ii$ is weakly contractible, then $\colimit_\Ii (\const *)\simeq |\Ii|\simeq *$ by \cref{prop:CoLimitsInCat} and the required conditions are easily checked. Therefore, the adjunction above descends to an adjunction 
	\begin{equation*}
		\colimit_\Ii\colon \Fun(\Ii,*/\An)\simeq (\const *)/\Fun(\Ii,\An)\doublelrmorphism */\An\noloc \const
	\end{equation*}
	in this case. If you think about this for a moment, this is exactly what we need to show that $*/\An\morphism \An$ commutes with colimits over $\Ii$.
	
	Similarly, once we have chosen a basepoint $x\in X$, it doesn't matter whether we take the defining pullback of $\Omega_xX$ in $*/\An$ or in $\An$ (and then equip it with its natural basepoint). This can be seen as above, or simply by the fact that $*/\An\morphism \An$ has a left adjoint, so we can apply \cref{obs:AdjointsPreserveLimits}. However, in contrast to $\Sigma$, we can't define $\Omega$ as a functor on $\An$, since there is no canonical choice of basepoint.
\end{rem*}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch of \cref{prop:FreeGroups}]
	The existence of a left adjoint would be immediate from Propositions~\labelcref{prop:InftyGrp,prop:FreeMonoids}, but we can give a direct argument that also yields the explicit description. We have seen in \cref{par:Grp(An)=(*/An)Connected} that the diagram
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\Grp(\An)\dar["|\blank|"']\rar["\ev_1"]& \An\\
			(*/\An)_{\geq 1}\urar["\Omega"',""{name=A,sloped}] & \arrow[from=1-1,to=A,phantom,"\scriptscriptstyle/\!/\!/"]
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	commutes. Observe that $(-)_+=-\sqcup*\colon \An\morphism */\An$ is a left adjoint of the forgetful functor $*/\An\morphism \An$ (this is basically trivial) and that $\Sigma\colon */\An\shortdoublelrmorphism */\An\noloc \Omega$ are adjoints (this we leave as an exercise---just play around with the defining pushouts/pullbacks, which can be taken in $*/\An$ by \cref{rem*:CoLimitsIn(*/An)OrAn}). Finally, $\Omega\colon (*/\An)_{\geq 1}\shortdoublelrmorphism \Grp(\An)\noloc |\blank|$ is an adjunction (even an equivalence) by \cref{par:Grp(An)=(*/An)Connected}. The assertion now follows from the fact that left adjoints compose.
\end{proof}
\begin{exm}\label{exm:MyFirstMonoidals}
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item The evaluation functor $\ev_1\colon \cat{Mon}(\An)\morphism \An$ factors canonically over $*/\An\morphism \An$, and the resulting functor $\ev_1\colon \cat{Mon}(\An)\morphism */\An$ has a left adjoint too. For a pointed anima $(X,x)$, we denote the corresponding left adjoint object (\enquote{free $\IE_1$-monoid with unit $x$}) by $\operatorname{Free}^{\IE_1}(X,x)$. Similarly, $\ev_1\colon \Grp(\An)\morphism */\An$ has a left adjoint given on objects by $\operatorname{Free}^{\IE_1}(X,x)^\inftygrp\simeq \Omega\Sigma X$ (this equality can be seen along the lines of the proof of \cref{prop:FreeGroups}).
		
		If $(X,x)$ is connected, one actually has $\operatorname{Free}^{\IE_1}(X,x)\simeq \operatorname{Free}^{\IE_1}(X,x)^\inftygrp$. Indeed, as we've seen in the proof of \cref{prop:Grp(An)=(*/An)Connected}, we only need to check that the ordinary monoid $\pi_0\operatorname{Free}^{\IE_1}(X,x)_1$ is already an ordinary group. Playing around with universal properties, we see that $\pi_0\operatorname{Free}^{\IE_1}(X,x)_1$ is the free ordinary monoid on the set $\pi_0 X$ with unit $[x]$, hence just $\{[x]\}$ itself since $X$ is connected, hence it already is a group.
		\item By \cref{prop:FreeMonoids}, $\operatorname{Free}^{\IE_1}(\IS^1)\simeq \coprod_{n\geq 0}\IT^n$ is an infinite union of tori $\IT^n=\prod_{i=1}^n\IS^1$ and thus a reasonable geometric object. However, \cref{prop:FreeGroups} implies
		\begin{equation*}
			\operatorname{Free}^{\IE_1}(\IS^1)^\inftygrp\simeq \Omega\Sigma(\IS^1_+)\simeq \Omega(\IS^2\vee\IS^1)\,,
		\end{equation*}
		and the homotopy groups of the right-hand side are not fully known to this day. Similarly, using the pointed variant from \itememph{a} above, we get
		\begin{equation*}
			\operatorname{Free}^{\IE_1}(\IS^1,*)\simeq\operatorname{Free}^{\IE_1}(\IS^1,*)^\inftygrp\simeq \Omega\Sigma(\IS^1,*)\simeq\Omega\IS^2
		\end{equation*}
		\item \lecture[A pushout computation. Monoidal $1$-categories give monoidal $\infty$-categories. Definition of algebraic and hermitian $K$-theory.]{2020-12-01}\hspace{-1ex}It is completely formal to see that $\ev_1\colon \cat{Mon}(\An)\morphism \An$ and $\ev_1\colon \Grp(\An)\morphism \An$ are represented by $\operatorname{Free}^{\IE_1}(*)$ and $\operatorname{Free}^{\IE_1}(*)^\inftygrp$ respectively. What's not formal, however, is that $\operatorname{Free}^{\IE_1}(*)\simeq \IN$ and $\operatorname{Free}^{\IE_1}(*)^\inftygrp\simeq \Omega \IS^1\simeq\IZ$, regarded as discrete simplicial anima. This really needs Propositions~\labelcref{prop:FreeMonoids,prop:FreeGroups}.
		
		Moreover, we'll see that the analogous functors are no longer represented by $\IN$ and $\IZ$ once we impose commutativity, even though they are the free $\IE_1$-monoid/group on a point and happen to be commutative. In fact they are \enquote{too commutative} (*\emph{sphere spectrum intensifie}s*).
		\item Let's for some reason compute the pushout
		\begin{equation*}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				\IN \rar["\cdot2"]\dar\drar[pushout] & \IN\dar\\
				* \rar & \IN /\!\!/ 2
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{equation*}
		in $\cat{Mon}(\An)$. The answer is $\IN/\!\!/ 2\simeq \Omega \IR\IP^2$. To see this, first observe that the functor $\pi_0\colon \cat{Mon}(\An)
		\morphism\cat{Mon}(\Set)$ commutes with colimits, so $\pi_0(\IN/\!\!/2)=\IZ/2$ since we know how to compute pushouts in $\cat{Mon}(\Set)$. But $\IZ/2$ is a group, so $\IN/\!\!/2\in \Grp(\An)$ by \cref{prop:Grp(An)=(*/An)Connected}. In particular, since the group completion functor $(-)^\inftygrp$ commutes with colimits, we get $\IN/\!\!/2\simeq \IZ/\!\!/2$, i.e., the diagram
		\begin{equation*}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				\IZ \rar["\cdot2"]\dar\drar[pushout] & \IZ\dar\\
				* \rar & \IN /\!\!/ 2
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{equation*}
		is a pushout in $\Grp(\An)$. Translating to $*/\An$ via \cref{prop:Grp(An)=(*/An)Connected} gives a diagram
		\begin{equation*}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				\IS^1\rar["\cdot 2"]\dar\drar[pushout] & \IS^1\dar\\
				\ID^2\rar & \IR\IP^2
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{equation*}
		(we have replaced $*$ by the disk $\ID^2$ to make one leg of the pushout into a cofibration so that it can be computed by an ordinary pushout of CW complexes by \cref{thm:HomotopyLimits}) and translating back using \cref{par:Grp(An)=(*/An)Connected} shows $\IN/\!\!/2\simeq \Omega\IR\IP^2$, as claimed.
		\item Every monoidal $1$-category $(\Cc,\otimes)$ gives rise to a monoidal $\infty$-category, i.e.\ an object in $\cat{Mon}(\Cat_1^{(2)})\subseteq \cat{Mon}(\Cat_\infty)$. We will produce this by straightening a suitable cocartesian fibration $p^{\otimes}\colon \Cc^\otimes\morphism \IDelta^\op$ of $1$-categories. Define $\Cc^\otimes\in \Cat_1^{(2)}$ as follows: Its objects are
		\begin{equation*}
			\operatorname{obj}(\Cc^\otimes)=\coprod_{n\geq 0}\operatorname{obj}(\Cc)^n\,,
		\end{equation*}
		i.e.\ given by tuples $(n, x_1,\dotsc,x_n)$ with $[n]\in \IDelta$ and $x_i\in \Cc$. We'll usually abbreviate $x=(x_1,\dotsc,x_n)$ and simply write $(n,x)$. Morphisms are defined as
		\begin{equation*}
			\Hom_{\Cc^\otimes}\big((n,x),(m,y)\big)=\left\{(\alpha,f)\st \begin{tabular}{c}
				$\alpha\colon [m]\rightarrow [n]$ in $\IDelta$ and $f=(f_1,\dotsc,f_m)$\\
				where $f_j\colon x_{\alpha(j-1)+1}\otimes\dotsb\otimes x_{\alpha(j)}\rightarrow y_j$\\
				are morphisms in $\Cc$ for all $j=1\dotsc,m$
			\end{tabular}\right\}\,.
		\end{equation*}
		If $\alpha(j-1)+1>\alpha(j)$ for some $j$, then $x_{\alpha(j-1)+1}\otimes\dotsb\otimes x_{\alpha(j)}$ is the empty tensor product, which is the tensor unit $1_\Cc\in\Cc$ by definition.
		
		The composition of $(\alpha,f)\colon(n,x)\morphism (m,y)$ and $(\beta,g)\colon (m,y)\morphism (k,z)$ is given as follows: Its first component is $\alpha\circ\beta\colon [k]\morphism{[n]}$. For the second component, observe that we can write
		\begin{equation*}
			x_{\alpha\beta(j-1)+1}\otimes \dotsb \otimes x_{\alpha\beta(j)}=\bigotimes_{i=1}^{\beta(j)-\beta(j-1)}\left(x_{\alpha(\beta(j-1)+i-1)+1}\otimes\dotsb\otimes x_{\alpha(\beta(j-1)+i)}\right)\,.
		\end{equation*}
		The $i\ordinalth$ tensor factor on the right maps to $y_{\beta(j-1)+i}$ via $f_{\beta(j-1)+i}$. Tensoring them together and postcomposing with $g_j\colon y_{\beta(j-1)+1}\otimes\dotsb\otimes z_j$ provides the desired composition of $f$ and $g$. This finishes the construction of $\Cc^\otimes$.
		
		The functor $p^\otimes\colon \Cc^\otimes\morphism\IDelta^\op$ just extracts $[n]$ from $(n,x)$ and $\alpha$ from $(\alpha,f)$. The fibres $\Cc_n^\otimes$ of $p^\otimes$ are then obviously given by $\Cc^n$. To show that $p$ is a cocartesian fibration of $1$-categories, we must provide cocartesian lifts of morphisms in $\IDelta^\op$. Given $\alpha\colon [m]\morphism {}[n]$ in $\IDelta$ and $(n,x)\in \Cc^\otimes$, we claim that the identities can be regarded as a morphism
		\begin{equation*}
			\alpha_*\colon (n,x)\morphism \left(m,x_{\alpha(0)+1}\otimes\dotsb\otimes x_{\alpha(1)},\dotsc,x_{\alpha(m-1)+1}\otimes\dotsb\otimes x_{\alpha(m)}\right)\,.
		\end{equation*}
		It's straightforward to check that $\alpha_*$ is a cocartesian lift of $\alpha$ (note that the daunting homotopy pullbacks in \cref{def:WeirdCocartesianDefinition} become just good old pullbacks of sets/discrete anima, since we are dealing with $1$-categories).
		
		It remains to check that $\St (p^\otimes)$ satisfies the conditions from \cref{def:CartesianMonoids}. As seen above, $\St (p^\otimes)_0\simeq \Cc_0^\otimes \simeq \Cc^0\simeq *$ is a point, as desired. To verify the Segal condition, let's organize the world a little bit. Call a map in $\IDelta$ \emph{inert} if it is the inclusion of an interval and \emph{active} if it preserves the largest and the smallest element. The Segal maps $e_i\colon [1]\morphism {}[n]$ are precisely the inert maps with source $[1]$. We claim that for a general inert map $\alpha\colon [m]\morphism{[n]}$, the induced functor (given by taking cocartesian lifts) 
		\begin{equation*}
			\alpha_*\colon \Cc^m\simeq \Cc_m^\otimes \morphism \Cc_n^\otimes \simeq \Cc^n
		\end{equation*}
		simply sends $(x_1,\dotsc,x_m)\in \Cc^m$ to $(x_{\alpha(1)},\dotsc,x_{\alpha(m)})\in \Cc^n$ with no tensor products occuring. Thus the Segal condition follows immediately.
		
		As a slogan, \enquote{inerts induce forgetful functors on fibres}, whereas \enquote{actives don't forget, they just tensor}. Generally, any map in $\IDelta$ can be uniquely factored into an inert followed by an active.
		\item The construction from \itememph{e} also works if $\Cc$ is Kan enriched. In this case one can again constructed a cocartesian fibration $p^\otimes\colon \Cc^\otimes \morphism \IDelta^\op$, but of Kan-enriched categories this time (where $\IDelta^\op$ receives its discrete enrichment). Then $\N^c(\Cc^\otimes)\morphism \N^c(\IDelta^\op)\simeq \IDelta^\op$ straightens to a monoidal $\infty$-category as well. Fabian wouldn't tell us what a cocartesian fibration of Kan-enriched categories is though, since this would take---not a lot, but too much---time.
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{exm}
%We're now very close to defining $K$-theory as $K_i(R)\coloneqq \pi_i\Omega (\Proj^\fg(R))^\inftygrp$ (or, if you prefer the Bar notation that Fabian hates, $\pi_i\Omega B(\Proj^\fg(R))$). What's left to do is to investigate $\Proj^\fg(R)$ and to turn it into an $\IE_1$-monoid.
\cref{exm:MyFirstMonoidals}\itememph{e} allows us to construct many interesting examples. All examples will turn out to be commutative, but that doesn't matter for now.

\numpar*{Algebraic $K$-Theory}
Let $R$ be a ring and consider $\cat{Mod}(R)$ as a monoidal category under $\oplus$. Moreover, let $\Proj(R)$ denote the sub-groupoid of spanned by finite projective $R$-modules (\enquote{vector bundles on $\Spec R$}) and their isomorphisms. This inherits a (symmetric) monoidal structure by \cref{exm:MyFirstMonoidals}\itememph{e}, so we obtain
	\begin{equation*}
		\Proj(R)\in \cat{Mon}\big(\Grpd_1^{(2)}\big)\subseteq \cat{Mon}(\An)\,.
	\end{equation*}
\begin{defi}[Quillen]
	The \emph{projective class anima} (or \emph{algebraic $K$-theory space}) of $R$ is defined as 
	\begin{equation*}
		k(R)\coloneqq \Proj(R)^\inftygrp\in \Grp(\An)\,,
	\end{equation*}
	and the \emph{higher projective class groups} (or \emph{higher $K$-groups}) of $R$ are given by
	\begin{equation*}
		K_i(R)=\pi_i\big(k(R)_1,*\big)\,.
	\end{equation*}
\end{defi}
The reason we write $k(R)$ is that the notation $K(R)$ is reserved for the $K$-theory \emph{spectrum} which we will eventually define. Note immediately that
\begin{equation*}
	K_0(R)=\pi_0\big(\Proj(R)^\inftygrp\big)=\big(\pi_0\Proj(R)\big)^\grp=\left\{\begin{tabular}{c}
		iso.\ classes of finite\\
		projective $R$-modules
	\end{tabular}\right\}^\grp\,,
\end{equation*}
where $(-)^\grp\colon \cat{Mon}(\Set)\morphism \Grp(\Set)$ denotes the ordinary group completion. This shows that $K_0(R)$ is precisely what we wanted it to be way back in the introduction, \cref{def:K0R}. We will soon see that also $K_1(R)$ can be described as in \cref{def:K1R}.


\numpar*{Hermitian $K$-Theory} Let $R$ be a ring, $M$ an $R\otimes R$-module and $\sigma\colon M\morphism M$ an involution that is flip-linear, i.e.\ $\sigma((a\otimes b)m)=(b\otimes a)\sigma(m)$. Moreover, assume that $M$ is finite projective when considered as an $R$-module via the map $R\simeq \IZ\otimes R\morphism R\otimes R$ (it doesn't matter if we choose this map or $R\simeq R\otimes \IZ\morphism R\otimes R$) and that the map
\begin{align*}
	R&\isomorphism \Hom_R(M,M)\\
	r&\longmapsto \big(m \mapsto (r\otimes 1)m\big)
\end{align*}
is an isomorphism. A pair $(M,\sigma)$ subject to these conditions is called an \emph{invertible module with involution} over $R$ (beware that this is non-standard terminology).

For a finite projective $R$-module $P\in \Proj (R)$ consider the group $\Hom_{R\otimes R}(P\otimes P,M)$ of $M$-valued $R$-bilinear forms on $P$. This is acted upon by $\IZ/2$ via conjugation with the flip of $P\otimes P$ and $\sigma$ on $M$. Define the groups of \emph{symmetric} and \emph{quadratic forms} on $P$ as
\begin{align*}
	\Sym_R(P,M)&\coloneqq \Hom_{R\otimes R}(P\otimes P,M)^{\IZ/2}\\
	\Quad_R(P,M)&\coloneqq \Hom_{R\otimes R}(P\otimes P,M)_{\IZ/2}\,,
\end{align*}
where $(-)^{\IZ/2}$ denotes the invariants of the $\IZ/2$-action and $(-)_{\IZ/2}$ denotes the coinvariants (i.e.\ take the coequalizer rather than the equalizer). Finally, let the group of \emph{even forms} on $P$ be
\begin{equation*}
	\Even_R(P,M)\coloneqq \im\left(\Nm\colon \Quad_R(P,M)\rightarrow \Sym_R(P,M)\right)\,,
\end{equation*}
where $\Nm$ denotes the \emph{norm map} which can be defined on general abelian groups with a $\IZ/2$-action: If $X\in \IZ/2\mhyph\Ab$ is an abelian group with $\IZ/2$ acting via an involution $\tau\colon X\morphism X$,
\begin{align*}
	\Nm\colon X_{\IZ/2}&\morphism X^{\IZ/2}\\
	[x]&\longmapsto x+\tau(x)\,.
\end{align*}
A symmetric form $q\in \Sym_R(P,M)$ is called \emph{unimodular} if the induced map
\begin{equation*}
	q_*\colon P\isomorphism \Hom_R(P,M)\eqqcolon D_M(P)
\end{equation*}
is an isomorphism. The right-hand side should be thought of the \enquote{$M$-valued dual} of $P$. This is reasonable because the assumptions on $M$ are chosen precisely to ensure that $D_M\colon \Proj(R)^\op\isomorphism \Proj(R)$ is an equivalence with inverse $D_M^\op$.

Similarly, an even or quadratic form is called \emph{unimodular} if their image in $\Sym_R(P,M)$ (via the inclusion or via $\Nm$) is unimodular. For $r\in\{\text{sym},\text{quad}, \text{even}\}$ we denote
\begin{equation*}
	\Unimod^r(P,M)=\left\{\begin{tabular}{c}
		groupoid of unimodular $r$-forms, i.e. pairs\\
		$(P,q)$, where $q$ is a unimodular $r$-form on $P$,\\
		and isomorphisms between them
	\end{tabular}\right\}
\end{equation*}
This is a symmetric monoidal $1$-groupoid via $\oplus$, hence induces a symmetric monoidal anima by \cref{exm:MyFirstMonoidals}\itememph{e}.
\begin{defi}[Karoubi]
	For $r\in\{\text{sym},\text{quad}, \text{even}\}$, the \emph{Grothendieck--Witt anima} of $(R,M)$ is given by
	\begin{equation*}
		\gw^r(R,M)\coloneqq \Unimod^r(R,M)^\inftygrp\,.
	\end{equation*}
\end{defi}
