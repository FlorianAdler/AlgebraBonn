\chapter{Symmetric Monoidal \texorpdfstring{$\infty$}{infty}-Categories and \texorpdfstring{$\IE_\infty$}{Einfty}-Spaces}
We start things off slowly by only considering (not necessarily symmetric) monoidal $\infty$-categories and $\IE_1$-spaces.
\numpar{Stasheff's Definition of Coherently Associative Monoids}
The naive way to define a monoid in $\An$ would be to have an object $M\in \An$ together with a multiplication map
\begin{equation*}
	\mu\colon M\times M\morphism M\,.
\end{equation*}
Now $\mu$ induces two different maps $M^3\morphism M$ (\enquote{two ways of bracketing}), so there ought to be a homotopy $H\colon \mu\circ (\mu\times \id_M)\simeq \mu\circ(\id_M\times \mu)$ between them. But then there are five maps $M^4\morphism M$ (\enquote{five ways of bracketing}), and we see that $H$ induces a loop in $\Hom_\An(M^4,M)$. Since $M$ should be associative up to \emph{coherent homotopy}, this loop has to be filled. The story goes on: There are a number of maps $M^5\morphism M$ (too lazy to count them) and now there are some $3$-simplices to be filled and so on.

Although this looks horrible, it is possible to turn these considerations into a precise definition, and one obtains Stasheff's \emph{$\IA_\infty$-spaces}. But we can take a simpler route! Indeed, thanks to our efforts so far, we now have the luxury of saying: \enquote{Well, a coherently associative monoid is just an $\infty$ category with only one object.} This leads to the following definition.
\begin{defi}\label{def:CartesianMonoids}
	Let $\Cc$ be an $\infty$-category with finite products (in particular, $\Cc$ has a final object $*\in \Cc$). A \emph{cartesian monoid in $\Cc$} is a functor $X\colon \IDelta^\op\morphism \Cc$ such that:
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item $X_0\simeq *$.
		\item It satisfies the Segal condition, i.e., the Segal maps $e_i\colon [1]\morphism {[n]}$ define an equivalence
		\begin{equation*}
			X_n\isomorphism \prod_{i=1}^nX_1
		\end{equation*}
	\end{alphanumerate}
	Let $\cat{Mon}(\Cc)\subseteq\cat{s}\Cc$ be the full sub-$\infty$-category spanned by cartesian monoids. If $\Cc=\An$, these are also called \emph{$\IE_1$-spaces}, \emph{$\IA_\infty$-spaces}, \emph{coherent monoids}, \emph{special $\Delta$-spaces}, \dotso. For $\Cc=\Cat_\infty$ we simply call them \emph{monoidal $\infty$-categories} (note that these can also be encoded as cocartesian fibrations over $\IDelta^\op$).
\end{defi}
To make sense of the condition from \cref{def:CartesianMonoids}\itememph{b}, note that since $X_0\simeq *$ is terminal, we have $X_1\times_{X_0}\times\dotsb\times_{X_0}X_1\simeq \prod_{i=1}^nX_1$, so this condition really \emph{is} the Segal condition. Somewhat weird though is that we don't impose any completeness conditions, and in fact, cartesian monoids in $\An$ are usually \emph{not} complete Segal spaces! This is in some sense fixed by the following proposition.
\begin{prop}\label{prop:CompletionOfMonoidsFullyFaithful}
	The completion functor $\comp\colon\cat{sAn}\morphism\cat{CSAn}$ from Lemma/Defi-nition~\labelcref{lemdef:Completion} restricts to a fully faithful functor
	\begin{equation*}
		\comp\colon\cat{Mon}(\An)\morphism */\cat{CSAn}
	\end{equation*}
	with essential image those pointed complete segal spaces $(X,x)$ with $\pi_0X_0=*$.
\end{prop}
In other words, monoids really are categories with one object (up to equivalence, but not up to contractible choice, as Bastiaan pointed out in the lecture), since the target is also pointed categories with connected base.
\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{prop:CompletionOfMonoidsFullyFaithful}]
	\emph{Step~1.} Let's construct a candidate for an inverse functor. Recall that if $X$ is Segal, then the completion functor does not affect the pullback spaces
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			P_{x,y}\rar\dar\drar[pullback] & X_1\dar["{(d_1,d_0)}"]\\
			*\rar["{(x,y)}"] & X_0\times X_0
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	(this follows essentially from \cref{eq:asscat2}). This motivates the following definition of an inverse (\enquote{decompletion}) functor $\decomp\colon */\cat{CSAn}\morphism \cat{Mon}(\An)$: Let $(X,x)$ be a pointed complete Segal space. We send it to $Y\in \cat{Mon}(\An)$, where $Y\colon \IDelta^\op\morphism \An$ is defined by the pullback
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large]
			Y_n\dar\rar\drar[pullback]& X_n\dar\\
			*\rar["{(x,\dotsc,x)}"] & X_0^{n+1}
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	for all $[n]\in \IDelta^\op$. Let's first address the elephant in the room, i.e.\ how to make the pointwise-defined $Y_n$ into a functor $\IDelta^\op\morphism \An$, which in turn should be functorial in $X$. We'll have solved both problems at once if we show that the diagram
	$*\morphism X_0^{n+1}\lmorphism X_n$ is functorial in $(X,x)$ and in $[n]$. To this end consider $X$ as a functor $\IDelta\morphism \An^\op$ and colimit-extend it to a functor
	\begin{equation*}
		|\blank|_X\colon \cat{sAn}\morphism \An^\op\,.
	\end{equation*}
	This can be done functorially in $X$, as \cref{thm:ColimitPreservingRepresentable} shows. In more abstract terms, what we do here is to identify  $\cat{sAn}\simeq \Fun(\IDelta,\An^\op)^\op\simeq \Fun^L(\cat{sAn},\An^\op)^\op$. We define two functors $\Delta,\Delta_0\colon \IDelta\morphism\cat{sSet}\subseteq\cat{sAn}$ via $\Delta([n])=\Delta^n$ and $\Delta_0([n])=\coprod_{i=0}^n\Delta^0$. Since $\Delta$ and $\Delta_0$ are functors between $1$-categories (before we compose them with the inclusion $\cat{sSet}\subseteq \cat{sAn}$), we don't need to check any higher coherences and immediately obtain that $\Delta$ and $\Delta_0$ are indeed functors. Moreover, the canonical map $\coprod_{i=0}^n\Delta^0\morphism \Delta^n$ sending the $i\ordinalth$ component to the $i\ordinalth$ vertex of $\Delta^n$ is clearly functorial in $[n]\in \IDelta$, hence it induces a natural transformation $\Delta_0\Rightarrow\Delta$ (which exhibits $\Delta_0$ as the \enquote{$0$-skeleton} of $\Delta$, hence the notation).
	
	Now consider the two composites
	\begin{equation*}
		\cat{sAn}\simeq \Fun\left(\IDelta,\An^\op\right)^\op\simeq \Fun\left(\cat{sAn},\An^\op\right)^\op\doublemorphism[\Delta^*][\Delta_0^*]\Fun\left(\IDelta,\An^\op\right)^\op\simeq \cat{sAn}\,,
	\end{equation*}
	which we denote $|\Delta|_{(-)}$ and $|\Delta_0|_{(-)}$. The transformation $\Delta_0\Rightarrow \Delta$ induces a transformation $|\Delta|_{(-)}\Rightarrow |\Delta_0|_{(-)}$ (since there has been an $(-)^\op$ in between). Upon closer inspection, we find that $\Delta\colon \IDelta\morphism\cat{sAn}$ is actually nothing else but the Yoneda embedding, hence \cref{thm:ColimitPreservingRepresentable} shows that $|\Delta|_{(-)}\simeq \id$! Moreover, since $|\blank|_X$ preserves colimits, we easily obtain
	\begin{equation*}
		X_0^{n+1}\simeq \left|\coprod_{i=0}^n\Delta^0\right|_X\,,
	\end{equation*}
	hence the $X_0^{n+1}$ can be organized into a simplicial anima $|\Delta_0|_X$. The transformation $\id\simeq |\Delta|_{(-)}\Rightarrow |\Delta_0|_{(-)}$ gives a natural map $X\morphism |\Delta_0|_X$.
	
	This shows that the maps $X_0^{n+1}\lmorphism X_n$ can indeed be made functorial in $X$ and $[n]$. A similar argument applies shows that the maps $*\morphism X_0^{n+1}$, which assemble into a functorial map $\Delta^0\morphism |\Delta_0|_X$. We conclude that $Y\simeq X\times_{|\Delta_0|_X}\Delta^0$ as above is indeed a simplicial anima and functorial in $X$. We have $Y_0\simeq *$ by construction and also $Y_n\simeq Y_1\times_{Y_0}\dotsb\times_{Y_0}Y_1$ follows from the fact that $X$ itself satisfies the Segal conditions together with some abstract pullback nonsense (basically that \enquote{limits commute}, see the dual of \cref{prop:ColimitsCommute}). So $Y\in \cat{Mon}(\An)$ and we can finally write down the functor
	\begin{equation*}
		\decomp\colon */\cat{CSAn}\morphism \cat{Mon}(\An)\,.
	\end{equation*}

	\emph{Step~2.} Next, let's check that $\comp\colon \cat{Mon}(\An)\morphism \cat{CSAn}$ from \cref{lemdef:Completion} indeed factors over $*/\cat{CSAn}\morphism \cat{CSAn}$ and that its essential image is contained in those pointed complete Segal spaces $(X,x)$ with $\pi_0X_0=*$. To get the factorization, observe that $\cat{Mon}(\An)$ has an initial object, namely $\Delta^0\in\sSet\subseteq\cat{sAn}$ (in the lecture we called it \enquote{$\const*$}, but it's really just $\Delta^0$). Indeed, if $T\in \cat{Mon}(\An)$, then
	\begin{equation*}
		\Hom_{\cat{Mon}(\An)}(\Delta^0,T)\simeq \Hom_{\cat{sAn}}(\Delta^0,T)\simeq T_0\simeq *
	\end{equation*}
	by \cref{def:CartesianMonoids}\itememph{a}. Also $\comp (\Delta^0)\simeq *$, so the completion functor really lifts to a functor $\cat{Mon}(\An)\simeq \Delta^0/\cat{Mon}(\An)\morphism */\cat{CSAn}$, as required.
	
	To check that $\pi_0(\comp T)_0=*$, recall that $(\comp T)_0\simeq \core \asscat T\simeq |T^\times|$ by \cref{eq:asscat1}. Now we have to use the following general fact:
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item[\itememph{*}] \itshape For all $X\in\cat{sAn}$ the map $\pi_0X_0\morphism \pi_0|X|$ is surjective.
	\end{alphanumerate}
	This shows what we want since $(T^\times)_0\simeq T_0\simeq *$ holds by assumption. To see where \itememph{*} comes from, observe that $\pi_0$, being a left adjoint (\cref{exm:MyFirstAdjoints}\itememph{a}), commutes with colimits. This shows $\pi_0|X|\simeq \pi_0\colimit_{\IDelta^\op}X\simeq \colimit_{\IDelta^\op}\pi_0X$, where the colimit on the right-hand side is a good old colimit taken in $\sSet$. Now $\{d_0,d_1\colon [1]\shortdoublemorphism [0]\}\subseteq \IDelta^\op$ is $1$-cofinal (but not $\infty$-cofinal!), hence
	\begin{equation*}
		\colimit_{\IDelta^\op}\pi_0X=\Coeq\left(\pi_0X_1\doublemorphism[d_1][d_0] \pi_0X_0\right)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	This immediately implies \itememph{*}.
	
	\emph{Step~3.} Finally, we check that $\decomp\colon (*/\cat{CSAn})_{\pi_0=*}\morphism \cat{Mon}(\An)$ is indeed an inverse, where $(*/\cat{CSAn})_{\pi_0=*}\subseteq */\cat{CSAn}$ is the full subcategory spanned by those $(X,x)$ with $\pi_0X_0=*$. The first step is to construct the required natural transformations. We didn't do this in the lecture (Fabian promised to give a full proof in the lecture notes soon), so here's what I would do. We claim:
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item[\itememph{\boxtimes}]\itshape The functors $\comp\colon \cat{Mon}(\An)\shortdoublelrmorphism */\cat{CSAn}\noloc \decomp$ form an adjunction.
	\end{alphanumerate}
	Once we proved \itememph{\boxtimes}, we get the required transformations for free. So let's do this! Consider $T\in \cat{Mon}(\An)$, which is naturally pointed via the unique (up to contractible choice) map $1_T\colon \Delta^0\morphism T$, and let $(X,x)$ be a pointed complete Segal space. Then
	\begin{align*}
		\Hom_{*/\cat{CSAn}}\big(\comp T,(X,x)\big)&\simeq \Hom_{*/\cat{sAn}}\big((T,1_T),(X,x)\big)\\
		&\simeq \Hom_{\cat{sAn}}(T,X)\times_{\Hom_{\cat{sAn}}(\const 1_T,X)}\{\const x\}\\
		&\simeq \Hom_{\cat{sAn}}(T,X)\times_{\Hom_\An(1_T,X_0)}\{x\}\,.
	\end{align*}
	The first equivalence follows from \cref{lemdef:Completion} (and the fact that adjunctions extend to slice categories), the second follows from \cite[Corollary~VIII.6]{HigherCatsII}. The last one follows by inspection. All of them are functorial in $(X,x)$. Moreover, we have
	\begin{align*}
		\Hom_{\cat{Mon}(\An)}\big(T,\decomp (X,x)\big)&\simeq \Hom_{\cat{sAn}}\left(T,X\times_{|\Delta_0|_X}\Delta^0\right)\\
		&\simeq \Hom_{\cat{sAn}}(T,X)\times_{\Hom_{\cat{sAn}}(T,|\Delta_0|_X)}\Hom_{\cat{sAn}}(T,\Delta^0)\,.
	\end{align*}
	Since $\id\Rightarrow |\Delta_0|_{(-)}$ is a natural transformation, one quickly checks that the morphism $\Hom_{\cat{sAn}}(T,X)\morphism \Hom_{\cat{sAn}}(T,|\Delta_0|_X)$ factors over $\Hom_{\cat{sAn}}(|\Delta_0|_T,|\Delta_0|_X)$. But $T_0\simeq *$, hence $|\Delta_0|_T\simeq \Delta^0$. Also $\Hom_{\cat{sAn}}(T,\Delta^0)\simeq *$. Putting everything together, we can rewrite
	\begin{equation*}
		\Hom_{\cat{Mon}(\An)}\big(T,\decomp (X,x)\big)\simeq \Hom_{\cat{sAn}}(T,X)\times_{\Hom_\An(T_0,X_0)}\{x\}\,,
	\end{equation*} 
	and after another inspection, this provides the required natural equivalence
	\begin{equation*}
		\Hom_{*/\cat{CSAn}}\big(\comp T,(X,x)\big)\simeq\Hom_{\cat{Mon}(\An)}\big(T,\decomp (X,x)\big)\,,
	\end{equation*}
	proving \itememph{\boxtimes}.
	
	Equipped with our newly-acquired unit and counit transformations $\id\Rightarrow \decomp\circ \comp$ and $\comp\circ\decomp\Rightarrow \id$, we now set out to prove that $\decomp\colon (*/\cat{CSAn})_{\pi_0=*}\morphism \cat{Mon}(\An)$ is indeed an inverse of $\comp$. Let's start with the second one, i.e.\ the counit. We must show $\comp(\decomp (X,x))\simeq (X,x)$ for all $(X,x)\in (*/\cat{CSAn})_{\pi_0=*}$ . Observe that $\comp X\simeq X$ because $X$ is already complete. Hence it suffices to show $\asscat(\decomp(X,x))\simeq \asscat X$ (and check that the chosen base points on both sides correspond, but that's easy) because $\N^r$ is fully faithful by \cref{thmdef:RezkNerve}. Using \cref{eq:asscat1} and the fact that $X^\times$ is a constant simplicial anima with value $X_0$ as $X$ is complete, we see that
	\begin{equation*}
		\pi_0\core(\asscat X)\simeq \pi_0|X^\times|\simeq \pi_0X_0\simeq *\,,
	\end{equation*}
	so $\asscat(\decomp(X,x))\morphism \asscat X$ is essentially surjective for trivial reasons. Moreover, we have $\decomp(X,x)_0\simeq \{x\}$ by construction, and \cref{eq:asscat2} (which is applicable here because $\decomp(X,x)$ is Segal by construction) easily shows
	\begin{equation*}
		\Hom_{\asscat(\decomp(X,x))}(x,x)\simeq P_{x,x}\simeq \Hom_{\asscat X}(x,x)\,,
	\end{equation*}
	so $\asscat(\decomp(X,x))\morphism \asscat(X)$ is fully faithful too. This shows that the counit is an equivalence, as claimed.
	
	The argument for the unit is similar: We have to show $T\simeq \decomp(\comp T)$ for all $T\in \cat{Mon}(\An)$. Since both sides are functors $\IDelta^\op\morphism \cat{An}$ and a natural transformation between them is already given, we can do this degree-wise by \cref{thm:JoyalEquivalence}\itememph{b}. Since both sides are cartesian monoids, is suffices to check that the map in degree $1$ is an equivalence, i.e.\ that $T_1\simeq \decomp(\comp T)_1$. Write $(X,x)\simeq \comp T$. By construction we have
	\begin{equation*}
		\decomp(X,x)_1\simeq P_{x,x}\quad\text{and}\quad T_1\simeq P_{1_T,1_T}\,,
	\end{equation*}
	where as usual $1_T\colon \Delta^0\morphism T$ is the natural pointing of $T$. As observed at the very beginning of this proof, the spaces $P_{y,z}$ aren't affected by completion, hence $P_{x,x}\simeq P_{1_T,1_T}$ and we're done. 
\end{proof}
