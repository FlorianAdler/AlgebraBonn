\section{The Modern Definition of \texorpdfstring{$K$}{K}-Theory}
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$K_0$}{K0} of a Stable \texorpdfstring{$\infty$}{Infinity}-Category}
\numpar{Some Motivation}
Throughout, we define the \emph{connective $K$-theory spectrum} of a ring $R$ to be $K(R)\coloneqq B^\infty k(R)$. One of our goals in this chapter will be to explain Quillen's fibre sequence
\begin{equation*}
 \bigoplus_{p\text{ prime}}K(\IF_p)\morphism  K(\IZ)\morphism K(\IQ)\,,
\end{equation*}
and more generally, for $R$ a Dedekind domain,
\begin{equation*}
	\bigoplus_{0\neq \pp\text{ prime}}K(R/\pp)\morphism  K(R)\morphism K(\Frac R)\,.
\end{equation*}
The immediate problem here is that $K(\IF_p)\morphism K(\IZ)$ and $K(R/\pp)\morphism K(R)$ can't possibly be induced by by ring maps $\IF_p\morphism \IZ$ or $R/\pp\morphism R$, since there are none. However, there are perfectly fine exact and fully faithful functors $\Dd(\IF_p)\morphism \Dd(\IZ)$ and $\Dd(R/\pp)\morphism \Dd(R)$, given by the inclusion of the $p$-torsion or $\pp$-torsion complexes, respectively. Motivated by that, we'll define $K$-theory of a ring in terms of its derived $\infty$-category $\Dd(R)$ (or really its sub-$\infty$-category $\Dd^\perf(R)$, see below), and once we're there, nothing can stop us from defining $K$-theory of arbitrary stable $\infty$-categories.

Before we move on, Fabian remarks that the sequences above already contain interesting information in low degrees. For example, after taking homotopy groups in degrees $0$ and $1$, the first sequence becomes
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=scriptsize]
		K_1(\IZ)\rar\eqar[d] & K_1(\IQ)\rar\eqar[d]& \displaystyle\bigoplus_{p\text{ prime}}K_0(\IF_p)\rar\eqar[d,shorten <=-1ex] & K_0(\IZ)\eqar[d]\rar &K_0(\IQ)\eqar[d]\\
		\{\pm 1\}\rar & \IQ^\times\rar & \displaystyle\bigoplus_{p\text{ prime}}\IZ\rar & \IZ\rar[iso] & \IZ
	\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
(we use \cref{prop:WhiteheadsLemma} to get $K_1(\IZ)=\IZ^\times=\{\pm1 \}$). The lower row yields an exact sequence
\begin{equation*}
	0\morphism \{\pm 1\}\morphism \IQ^\times\morphism \bigoplus_{p\text{ prime}}\IZ\morphism 0\,,
\end{equation*}
which says precisely that $\IZ$ has unique prime decomposition. In a similar way, the sequence for arbitrary Dedekind domains encodes their unique prime ideal decomposition.
\refstepcounter{smallerdummy}
\numpar*{\thesmallerdummy. Perfect Modules and Complexes}
To get started, we note that $K_0(R)$ admits more cycles than just projective modules: Let $M\in\Mod_R$ be a \emph{perfect module}, that is, a module admitting a finite projective resolution
\begin{equation*}
	0\morphism P_n\morphism P_{n-1}\morphism \dotso \morphism P_0\morphism M\morphism 0\,.
\end{equation*}
Then we can put
\begin{equation*}
	[M]\coloneqq \sum_{i=0}^n(-1)^i[P_i]\in K_0(R)\,.
\end{equation*}
\begin{exc}\label{exc:EulerCharacteristicWellDefined}
	Show that $[M]$ is independent of the choice of resolution!
\end{exc}
So you don't need a projective module to specify an element in $K_0(R)$, all you need is a \emph{perfect} one! More generally, let $\Dd^\perf(R)\subseteq \Dd(R)$ denote the full sub-$\infty$-category spanned by the finite complexes of finite projective $R$-modules.  One can show that these are precisely the compact objects in $\Dd(R)$.
\begin{lem}\label{lem:K0DperfR}
	Sending a perfect complex $(P_n\rightarrow P_{n-1}\rightarrow \dotso \rightarrow P_{-m})$ to its \enquote{Euler characteristic} $\sum_{i=-m}^n(-1)^i[P_i]$ defines an isomorphism
	\begin{equation*}
		\big(\pi_0\core\Dd^\perf(R)\big)/\sim_{\mathrm{ext}}\isomorphism K_0(R)
	\end{equation*}
	where \enquote{$\sim_\mathrm{ext}$} is the equivalence relation generated by $B\sim_{\mathrm{ext}} A\oplus C$ for all fibre sequences $A\morphism B\morphism C$ in $\Dd^\perf(R)$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof*}
	Well-definedness of the map follows from a sufficient generalisation of \cref{exc:EulerCharacteristicWellDefined}. If $P$ is any finite projective module over $R$, then also $P[1]\in \Dd^\perf(R)$, which is mapped to $-[P]$. Hence the map in question hits all inverses and is thus surjective. 
	
	It remains to show injectivity. Since the map in question is compatible with the addition on both sides, it suffices to show that $K\in \Dd^\perf(R)$ being mapped to $0$ implies $K\sim_{\mathrm{ext}}0$. Write $K\simeq (P_n\rightarrow P_{n-1}\rightarrow \dotso \rightarrow P_{-m})$. Taking stupid truncations gives fibre sequences $P_{-m}[-m]\morphism K\morphism K_{\geq -m+1}$, which proves $K\sim_{\mathrm{ext}} P_{-m}[-m]\oplus K_{\geq -m+1}$. Continuing inductively, we may thus replace $K$ by the sum of its entries, with all differentials being $0$. Next, we note that $P_{-m}[i-1]\morphism 0 \morphism P_{-m}[i]$ are fibre sequences for all $i\in\IZ$, so we get $P_{-m}[i-1]\oplus P_{-m}[i]\sim_{\mathrm{ext}}0$. Applying this first for $i=-m+2$ and then backwards for $i=-m+1$ gives
	\begin{align*}
		K\simeq \bigoplus_{i=-m}^nP_{i}[i]&\sim_\mathrm{ext} P_{-m}[-m+2]\oplus P_{-m}[-m+1]\oplus\bigoplus_{i=-m}^nP_{i}[i]\\
		&\sim_{\mathrm{ext}} P_{-m}[-m+2]\oplus \bigoplus_{i=-m+1}^nP_{i}[i]\,.
	\end{align*}
	Continuing inductively, we see that we may shift all even degrees into degree $0$, and all odd degrees into degree $1$. Hence we may assume $K\simeq P_0[0]\oplus P_1[1]$. Now $K$ being mapped to $0$ implies $[P_0]=[P_1]$, hence, by construction of the Grothendieck group completion, there exists a finite projective module $Q$ such that $P_0\oplus Q\simeq P_1\oplus Q$. But by an argument we've already seen, $Q\oplus Q[1]\sim_{\mathrm{ext}}0$, hence $K\sim_{\mathrm{ext}} (P_0\oplus Q)[0]\oplus (P_1\oplus Q)[1]$. This has again the form $P'[0]\oplus P'[1]$, hence $K\sim_{\mathrm{ext}} 0$ and we're done.
\end{proof*}
\begin{defi}
	Given a (small) stable $\infty$-category $\Cc$, put
	\begin{equation*}
		K_0(\Cc)\coloneqq \pi_0\core(\Cc)/\sim_{\mathrm{ext}}\,,
	\end{equation*}
	where again \enquote{$\sim_\mathrm{ext}$} is the equivalence relation generated by $b\sim_{\mathrm{ext}} a\oplus c$ for all fibre sequences sequence $a\morphism b\morphism x$ in $\Cc$.
\end{defi}
One easily checks that taking direct sums in $\Cc$ descends to an abelian group structure on $K_0(\Cc)$. For example, inverses are given by $-[c]=[\Sigma c]=[\Omega c]$.

The functor $K_0(-)\colon \Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st}\morphism\Ab$ is already an interesting invariant, in that it parametrises \emph{dense sub-$\infty$-categories}: We call a full sub-$\infty$-category $\Dd\subseteq \Cc$ \emph{dense} if every object in $\Cc$ can be written as a retract of some $d\in \Dd$, i.e., there are maps
\begin{equation*}
	c\morphism d\morphism c
\end{equation*}
composing to $\id_c$. For example, free $R$-modules are dense in $\Proj(R)$.
\begin{thm}[Thomason {\cite[Theorem~2.1]{ThomasonClassification}}]\label{thm:ThomasonDenseSubcategories}
	If $\Cc$ is a stable $\infty$-categories and $\Dd\subseteq\Cc$ a dense stable sub-$\infty$-category, then the inclusion induces an injection
	\begin{equation*}
		K_0(\Dd)\monomorphism K_0(\Cc)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Moreover, there's a \enquote{Galois correspondence} of partially ordered sets
	\begin{align*}
		\left\{\text{dense stable sub-$\infty$-categories of $\Cc$}\right\}&\isomorphism \left\{\text{subgroups of $K_0(\Cc)$}\right\}\\
		D\subseteq \Cc&\longmapsto K_0(D)\\
		\Cc^H\coloneqq\big\{x\in\Cc\ \big|\ [x]\in H\big\}&\longmapsfrom H\subseteq K_0(\Cc)
	\end{align*}
\end{thm}
\begin{warn*}\label{warn*:StableSubcategory}
	Two remarks on our \enquote{sub-$\infty$-category} terminology.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item By saying \emph{stable sub-$\infty$-category}, we always implicitly assume that $\Dd\morphism\Cc$ is a functor in $\Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st}$, i.e.\ exact. In particular, being a stable sub-$\infty$-category is slightly stronger than being a sub-$\infty$-category that happens to be stable.
		\item The left-hand side of the \enquote{Galois correspondence} is a bit ambiguous in that a priori there might be equivalent but non-equal sub-$\infty$-categories of $\Cc$. So depending on your taste, you either have to identify two sub-$\infty$-categories if their essential images agree, or you have to restrict to only those sub-$\infty$-categories $\Dd\subseteq \Cc$ which are equal (as simplicial sets) to their essential image, or equivalently, those $\Dd\subseteq \Cc$ such that $\Dd\morphism\Cc$ is an isofibration.
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{warn*}
\refstepcounter{smallerdummy}
\numpar*{\thesmallerdummy. Example}
\cref{thm:ThomasonDenseSubcategories} tells us that the smallest dense stable sub-$\infty$-category
\begin{equation*}
	\Dd^\mathrm{free}(R)\subseteq \Dd^\perf(R)
\end{equation*}
containing $R[0]$ corresponds to $\im(\IZ\morphism K_0(R))$, since the image of $R[0]$ in $K_0(R)$ is $1$. Moreover, any stable $\infty$-category $\Cc$ has a smallest dense stable sub-$\infty$-category
\begin{equation*}
	\Cc^0=\big\{x\in\Cc\ \big|\ [x]=0\text{ in }K_0(\Cc)\big\}\,.
\end{equation*}
Already the existence of such a smallest dense stable sub-$\infty$-category is not quite obvious.
\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{thm:ThomasonDenseSubcategories}]
	Injectivity will be the very last thing we check, so throughout the proof we work with the image
	\begin{equation*}
		H_\Dd\coloneqq\im\big(K_0(\Dd)\rightarrow K_0(\Cc)\big) 
	\end{equation*}
	instead. We will proceed in two steps.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item[\itememph{1}] \itshape In \embrace{temporary} absence of injectivity, we will show the \enquote{Galois correspondence} with $K_0(\Dd)$ replaced by $H_\Dd$.
	\end{alphanumerate}
	
	We will do this by verifying that the map $H\mapsto \Cc^H$ in the reverse direction is an inverse. So the first thing to check is that $\Cc^H$ is indeed a dense stable sub-$\infty$-category of $\Cc$. Since $\Cc\morphism K_0(\Cc)$ is additive with respect to finite direct sums and fibre sequences, one immediately verifies that $\Cc^H\subseteq \Cc$ is closed under finite limits and colimits, hence it is indeed a stable sub-$\infty$-category. It is also dense because every $x\in \Cc$ is a retract of $x\oplus \Sigma x$, but $[x\oplus \Sigma x]=0\in H$, so $x\oplus \Sigma x$ is always an element of $\Cc^H$.
	
	Next, we check $H_{\Cc^H}=H$. Clearly $\im(K_0(\Cc^H)\morphism K_0(\Cc))\subseteq H$. But for any $h\in H$ there is an $x\in \Cc$ with $[x]=h$, and then $x\in \Cc^H$ by definition, hence the inclusion must be an equality. This shows $H_{\Cc^H}=H$.
	
	It remains to check $\Cc^{H_\Dd}=\Dd$. Unravelling, what we need to check is that $x\in \Dd$ iff $[x]\in H_\Dd$, which is the case iff $[x]=0$ in $K_0(\Cc)/H_\Dd$. To show this, we introduce another equivalence relation \enquote{$\sim$} on $\Cc$: Put $x\sim x'$ iff there exist $d,d'\in\Dd$ with $x\oplus d\simeq x'\oplus d'$. It's easy to check that \enquote{$\sim$} is indeed an equivalence relation, and also it clearly descends to $\pi_0\core(\Cc)$. Moreover, we have $x\sim 0$ iff $x\in\Dd$. Indeed, $x\in\Dd$ implies $x\sim 0$ as $x\oplus 0\simeq 0\oplus x$ and $0,x\in\Dd$. Conversely, if $x\oplus d\simeq d'$ for some $d,d'\in \Dd$, then $x\morphism d'\morphism d$ is a fibre sequence in $\Cc$, two of whose terms are in $\Dd$, hence the third term must be in $\Dd$ as well because $\Dd\subseteq \Cc$ is a stable sub-$\infty$-category (in the sense of \cref{warn*:StableSubcategory}\itememph{a}).
	
	By our newfound knowledge, we see now that to prove $\Cc^{H_\Dd}=\Dd$, it suffices to check that $x\sim x'$ iff $[x]-[x']\in H_\Dd$. To show this, we first observe that taking direct sums turns $\pi_0\core(\Cc)/\sim$ into an abelian group. Indeed, well-definedness, associativity and commutativity of addition is clear, as is the existence of  a neutral element. For inverses, recall that every $x\in \Cc$ is a retract of some $d\in\Dd$ by assumption, hence $d\simeq x\oplus x'$ for $x'\simeq \cofib(x\morphism d)\in \Cc$. But then $x'$ provides an inverse of $x$. Furthermore, the map $\pi_0\core(\Cc)\morphism \pi_0\core(\Cc)/\sim$ descends to a map
	\begin{equation*}
		K_0(\Cc)\morphism \pi_0\core(\Cc)/\sim\,.
	\end{equation*}
	To verify this, we must check that $y\sim x\oplus z$ for every fibre sequence $x\morphism y\morphism z$ in $\Cc$. But there elements $x',z'\in \Cc$ such that $x\oplus x',z\oplus z'\in \Dd$, and $x\oplus x'\morphism y\oplus x'\oplus z'\morphism z\oplus z'$ is still a fibre sequence. But now two of its terms are in $\Dd$, hence also $y\oplus x'\oplus z'\in \Dd$ because $\Dd\subseteq \Cc$ is a stable sub-$\infty$-category (in the sense of \cref{warn*:StableSubcategory}\itememph{a}). Now the elements $d=x\oplus x'\oplus z\oplus z'\in \Dd$ and $d'=y\oplus x'\oplus z'\in \Dd$ satisfy $y\oplus d\simeq x\oplus z\oplus d'$, thus witnessing $y\sim x\oplus z$. This shows that we really get a homomorphism $K_0(\Cc)\morphism \pi_0\core(\Cc)/\sim$ of abelian groups.
	
	This homomorphism is surjective for trivial reasons. Since we checked above that $x\sim 0$ iff $x\in \Dd$, the kernel must consist precisely of those $[x]$ such that $[x]=[d]$ for some $d\in \Dd$. That is, the kernel is $H_\Dd$, which means the proof of the \enquote{Galois correspondence} is done!
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item[\itememph{2}] \itshape Finally, we prove that $K_0(\Dd)\morphism K_0(\Cc)$ is injective.
	\end{alphanumerate}
	
	 Thomason does this with a bit of a trick: Let's denote $N=\ker(K_0(\Dd)\morphism K_0(\Cc))$. Since $\Dd$ is stable too, we can also run the Galois correspondence machinery for $\Dd$ and obtain dense stable sub-$\infty$-category $\Dd^0\subseteq\Dd^N\subseteq \Dd$, corresponding to the trivial subgroup of $K_0(\Dd)$ and $N\subseteq K_0(\Dd)$, respectively. One easily checks that $\Dd^0$ and $\Dd^N$ are also dense stable sub-$\infty$-categories of $\Cc$. But $K_0(\Dd^0)\morphism K_0(\Cc)$ and $K_0(\Dd^N)\morphism K_0(\Cc)$ both have image $0$, hence $\Dd^0=\Dd^N$ as full sub-$\infty$-categories of $\Cc$. But then $K_0(\Dd^0)\morphism K_0(\Dd)$ and $K_0(\Dd^N)\morphism K_0(\Dd)$ must have the same image, which proves $N=0$.
\end{proof}
\subsection{The \texorpdfstring{$S$}{S}-Construction and the \texorpdfstring{$Q$}{Q}-Construction}
\lecture[The Waldhausen $S$-construction and $K$-theory of stable $\infty$-categories. The $S$-construction vs.\ the $Q$-construction. The resolution theorem.]{2021-02-02}
Our next goal is to construct a $K$-theory functor
\begin{equation*}
	k\colon \Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st}\morphism \CGrp(\An)\,.
\end{equation*}
As we've already seen in the baby case of $K_0(\Cc)$, we now longer have to group complete. Instead, what we have to do is to \enquote{split all fibre sequences}. A fibre sequence $a\morphism b\morphism c$ can be thought of as a filtered object $a\morphism b$ of length $1$, together with its filtration quotient $c\simeq b/a$. So the logical next step is to consider filtered objects of arbitrary length. This leads us to the \emph{Segal $S$-construction} (people keep calling it \emph{Waldhausen} $S$-construction, even though Waldhausen himself wrote \emph{Segal} $S$-construction).
%\stepcounter{dummy}
\begin{con}\label{con:SConstruction}
	Let $\Cc$ be a stable $\infty$-category. For all $[n]\in \IDelta^\op$, let
	\begin{equation*}
		S_n(\Cc)\subseteq \Fun\big(\Ar([n]),\Cc\big)
	\end{equation*}
	be the full sub-$\infty$-category of those functors $F\colon \Ar([n])\morphism \Cc$ satisfying the following two conditions:
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item $F(i\leq i)=0$ for all $i=0,\dotsc,n$.
		\item All \enquote{squares} in $\Ar([n])$ go to pushouts/pullbacks (these are the same in the stable $\infty$-category $\Cc$), as indicated in the picture below.
	\end{alphanumerate}
	To make sense of \itememph{b}, recall from \cref{par:MoreOnTwAr} that $\Ar([n])$ can be pictured as follows (the colour coding will be explained in a moment):

	Now \itememph{b} is equivalent to $F$ being left Kan extended from the \enquote{yellow} part. Together with \itememph{a}, this implies
	\begin{equation*}
		S_n(\Cc)\simeq \Fun\big([n-1],\Cc\big)
	\end{equation*}
	via restriction to the \enquote{dotted} part in the top row. Hence $S_n(\Cc)$ is stable again. Moreover, $\Fun(\Ar[n],\Cc)$ is clearly functorial both in $[n]$ and $\Cc$, and one checks that the full subcategories $S_n(\Cc)$ are preserved under the face and degeneracy maps in $\IDelta^\op$. Hence $S(C)\colon \IDelta^\op\morphism \Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st}$ is a simplicial stable $\infty$-category, and we get a functor
	\begin{equation*}
		S\colon \Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st}\morphism \cat{sCat}_\infty^\mathrm{st}\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Unravelling, we find that $S_0(\Cc)\simeq *$, $S_1(\Cc)\simeq \Cc$, and $S_1(\Cc)\simeq \Ar(\Cc)$. But we think of the typical element of $S_2(\Cc)$ as a diagram
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			0\rar & a \rar\dar \drar[pushout]& b\dar\\
			& 0\rar & b/a\dar\\
			& & 0
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	rather than an arrow $a\morphism b$. In this picture, the face maps $d_0,d_1,d_2\colon S_2(\Cc)\morphism S_1(\Cc)\simeq \Cc$ extract the objects $b/a$, $b$, and $a$, respectively.
	
	Also note that we have $\pi_0\left|\core S(\Cc)\right|=0$, since it is a general fact that $\pi_0X_0\morphism \pi_0\left|X\right|$ is surjective for all simplicial anima $X$ (see \itememph{*} in the proof of \cref{prop:CompletionOfMonoidsFullyFaithful}).
\end{con}
\begin{defi}\label{def:KTheoryOfStableInftyCategories}
	For a stable $\infty$-category $\Cc$, we define
	\begin{equation*}
		k(\Cc)\coloneqq \Omega \left|\core S(\Cc)\right|\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Since $\left|\core S(\Cc)\right|$ is connected, there's no need to specify a basepoint.
\end{defi}
\begin{lem}\label{lem:SkeletalInduction}
	For all stable $\infty$-categories $\Cc$, there is a canonical isomorphism
	\begin{equation*}
		K_0(\Cc)\simeq \pi_0\big(k(\Cc)\big)\simeq \pi_1\big(\left|\core(\Cc)\right|\big)\,.
	\end{equation*}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
	The second isomorphism is clear as the loop functor shifts homotopy groups down. Hence it suffices to show $K_0(\Cc)\simeq \pi_1(\left|\core(\Cc)\right|)$. This will be done using skeletal induction. We didn't talk about how this works for simplicial anima, so this proof also serves as a demonstration of the technique (although we will actually do skeletal induction for semi-simplicial anima, since that's somewhat easier and sufficient for our purposes).
	
	Let $\IDelta_\mathrm{inj}\subseteq\IDelta$ be the subcategory spanned by the injective maps. It is \emph{wide}, i.e.\ contains all objects, but obviously not full. Using the criterion from \cref{thm:JoyalQuillenThmA}\itememph{b}, one easily checks that $\IDelta^\op_\mathrm{inj}\subseteq \IDelta^\op$ is cofinal. So instead of the realisation $|X|\simeq \colimit_{\IDelta^\op}X$ of some simplicial anima $X$, we may consider the colimit over $\IDelta^\op_\mathrm{inj}$ of its restriction. Somewhat abusingly, we won't distinguish between $X$ and its restriction to $\IDelta^\op_\mathrm{inj}$. 
	
	Next, let's define the skeletal filtration on $X$. For all $n\geq 0$, let $i_n$ denote the inclusion $\IDelta_{\mathrm{inj},\leq n}\subseteq \IDelta_\mathrm{inj}^\op$. Then put
	\begin{equation*}
		\sk_n X\coloneqq \Lan_{i_n} i_n^*X\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Using the explicit fromulas from \cref{thm:KanExtension}, one unravels 
	\begin{equation*}
		(\sk_nX)_k\simeq \begin{cases*}
			X_k & if $k\leq n$\\
			\emptyset & if $k> n$
		\end{cases*}\,.
	\end{equation*}
	The $\sk_nX$ assemble into a functor $\sk X\colon \IN\morphism \Fun(\IDelta_\mathrm{inj}^\op,\An)$ with colimit $X$ (which is clear from the above description and the fact that colimits in functor categories are pointwise).
	
	Now consider
	\begin{equation*}
		\snake{\Delta}^n =\Hom_{\IDelta^\op_\mathrm{inj}}\big(-,[n]\big)\quad\text{and}\quad \partial \snake{\Delta}^n=\sk_{n-1}\snake{\Delta}^n
	\end{equation*}
	in $\Fun(\IDelta^\op_\mathrm{inj},\An)$, the \enquote{semi-simplicial $n$-simplex} and its \enquote{boundary}. Note that $\snake{\Delta}^n$ and $\partial \snake{\Delta}^n$ are \emph{not} the restrictions of $\Delta^n$ and $\partial \Delta^n$ to $\IDelta_\mathrm{inj}^\op$! However, $\Delta^n$ and $\partial \Delta^n$ are the left Kan extensions of $\snake{\Delta}^n$ and $\partial \snake{\Delta}^n$  along $\IDelta^\op_\mathrm{inj}\subseteq \IDelta^\op$ by \cref{cor:f_!:PC->PD}. Hence
	\begin{equation*}
	 	|\snake{\Delta}^n|\simeq |\Delta^n|\simeq *\quad\text{and}\quad |\partial\snake{\Delta}^n|\simeq |\partial\Delta^n|\simeq \IS^{n-1}\,,
	\end{equation*}
 	where we use that $\colimit_{\IDelta_{\mathrm{inj}}^\op}$ and $\colimit_{\IDelta^\op}$ are the left Kan extension functors along $\IDelta_\mathrm{inj}^\op\morphism *$ and $\IDelta^\op\morphism *$, respectively, and left Kan extension composes. 
	
	By direct inspection there are pushouts
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:SkeletalInduction0}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\partial\snake{\Delta}^{n+1}\times \const X_{n+1}\dar\rar\drar[pushout] & \sk_n X\dar\\
			\snake{\Delta}^{n+1}\times \const X_{n+1}\rar & \sk_{n+1}X
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation}
	for all $n\geq 0$ (just write out the definitions and everything will be trivial in each degree). Taking realisations everywhere gives pushouts
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:SkeletalInduction}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\IS^n\times X_{n+1}\dar\rar\drar[pushout] & {\left|\sk_n X\right|}\dar\\
			X_{n+1}\rar & {\left|\sk_{n+1}X\right|}
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation}
	for all $n\geq 0$. But be aware of \cref{warn:SemisimplicialRealisationDoesntCommuteWithProducts} below!
	
	
	Now apply \cref{eq:SkeletalInduction} to $X\simeq \core S(\Cc)$ in the case $n=0$. We know $S_1(\Cc)\simeq \Cc$ and hence $\IS^0\times \core S_1(\Cc)\simeq \core(\Cc)\sqcup \core(\Cc)$. Thus the pushout diagram in question appears as
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\core(\Cc)\sqcup\core(\Cc)\dar\rar\drar[pushout] & {\left|\sk_0 \core S(\Cc)\right|}\dar\\
			\core(\Cc) \rar & {\left|\sk_{1}\core S(\Cc)\right|}
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	We also know $S_0(\Cc)\simeq *$, hence $\sk_0\core S(\Cc)\simeq \snake{\Delta}^0$. Plugging this into the pushout above and playing a bit around with it then shows $\left|\sk_{1}\core S(\Cc)\right|\simeq \Sigma(\core(\Cc)\sqcup *)\simeq \Sigma(\core(\Cc)_+)$. Hence $\Omega \left|\sk_{1}\core S(\Cc)\right|\simeq \Omega\Sigma (\core(\Cc)_+)\simeq \Free^\Grp(\core(\Cc))$ by \cref{prop:FreeGroups}. Therefore
	\begin{equation*}
		\pi_1\left|\sk_{1}\core S(\Cc)\right|= \pi_0\Free^\Grp\big(\core(\Cc)\big)=\Free^{\Grp(\Set)}\big(\pi_0\core(\Cc)\big)
	\end{equation*}
	is the free ordinary group on the set $\pi_0\core(\Cc)$.
	
	Next, we apply \cref{eq:SkeletalInduction} to $X\simeq \core S(\Cc)$ in the case $n=1$. Plugging in what we know so far, the pushout in question appears as
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\IS^1\times \core S_2(\Cc)\dar\rar\drar[pushout] & \Sigma\big(\core(\Cc)\sqcup *\big)\dar\\
			\core S_2(\Cc)\rar & {\left|\sk_2\core S(\Cc)\right|}
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	This enables us to compute $\pi_1\left|\sk_2\core S(\Cc)\right|$ using the Seifert--van Kampen theorem (\cite[Theorem~1.20]{Hatcher}). But note that $\core S_2(\Cc)$ isn't necessarily connected; rather, each equivalence class in $S_2(\Cc)$ defines a connected component. So in order to use Seifert--van Kampen in its usual formulation, we have to decompose $\core S_2(\Cc)\simeq \coprod_{s}(\core S_2(\Cc))_s$ into pathcomponents and then iteratively form the pushout along $\IS^1\times (\core S_2(\Cc))_s\morphism (\core S_2(\Cc))_s$ (where the \enquote{number} of iterations can be any ordinal).
	
	So choose an element $s\in \core S_2(\Cc)$, which we may think of as a cofibre sequence
	\begin{equation*}
		s=(a\morphism b\morphism b/a)
	\end{equation*}
	in $\Cc$, and let's unravel what the top row map does on fundamental groups. We know $\pi_1\Sigma(\core(\Cc)\sqcup *)=\Free^{\Grp(\Set)}(\pi_0\core(\Cc))$, $\pi_1(\IS^1)=\IZ$, and that $\pi_1$ commutes with products. We claim that the ensuing map
	\begin{equation*}
		\IZ\times \pi_1\big(\core S_2(\Cc),s\big)\morphism \Free^{\Grp(\Set)}\big(\pi_0\core(\Cc)\big)
	\end{equation*}
	sends $(1,e)\mapsto a\cdot b^{-1}\cdot b/a$  and $(0,\gamma)\mapsto e$ for all $\gamma\in \pi_1(\core S_2(\Cc),s)$, where $e$ denotes the respective neutral elements. Indeed, $(1,e)$ corresponds to walking once around the perimeter of $\IS^1\simeq |\partial\snake{\Delta}^1|$ and taking boundary maps, which are given by $d_2(s)\simeq a$, $d_1(s)\simeq b$, and $d_0(s)\simeq b/a$ in that order (see the end of \cref{con:SConstruction}). The argument for $(0,\gamma)$ is similar. To make all of this really precise,  we would have to unravel what the top row  map $\partial\snake{\Delta}^{n+1}\times \const X_{n+1}\morphism \sk_n X$ from \cref{eq:SkeletalInduction0} does, but let's not get into the details there.
	
	So taking the pushout 
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\IZ\times \pi_1\big(\core S_2(\Cc),s\big)\dar["\pr_2"]\drar[pushout]\rar &\Free^{\Grp(\Set)}\big(\pi_0\core(\Cc)\big)\dar[dashed]\\
			\pi_1\big(\core S_2(\Cc),s\big) \rar[dashed] & \boldsymbol{?}
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	in $\Grp(\Set)$ (which is what the Seifert--van Kampen theorem does) precisely enforces the relation $[b]=[b/a]\cdot [a]$ in the free group $\Free^{\Grp(\Set)}(\pi_0\core(\Cc))$. Doing this for all cofibre sequences in $\Cc$ thus provides an isomorphism
	\begin{equation*}
		K_0(\Cc)\simeq \pi_1\big(\left|\sk_2\core S_2(\Cc)\right|\big)
	\end{equation*}
	(note in particular that $a\morphism a\oplus c\morphism c$ is always a fibre sequence, hence $[a\oplus c]=[a]\cdot [c]$, and then by swapping $a$ and $c$ also $[a\oplus c]=[c]\cdot [a]$). Thus we are almost done and it only remains to show $\pi_1(|\sk_2\core S (\Cc)|)=\pi_1(\left|\core(\Cc)\right|)$. But it follows from \cref{eq:SkeletalInduction} and the Seifert--van Kampen theorem again that the fundamental group doesn't change anymore in the higher skeleta (because $\pi_1(\IS^n)=0$ for $n\geq 2$). Thus, as $\pi_1$ commutes with sequential colimits by \cref{lem:piPreservesSequentialColimits},
	\begin{align*}
		\pi_1\big(\left|\core(\Cc)\right|\big)&=\pi_1\left(\colimit_{n\in\IN}\left|\sk_n\core S_2(\Cc)\right|\right)\\
		&=\colimit_{n\in\IN}\pi_1\big(\left|\sk_2\core S_2(\Cc)\right|\big)\\
		&=\pi_1\big(\left|\sk_2\core S_2(\Cc)\right|\big)\,.\tag*{\qedhere}
	\end{align*}
\end{proof}
\begin{smallwarn}\label{warn:SemisimplicialRealisationDoesntCommuteWithProducts}
	In contrast to the realisation of simplicial anima (see \cref{prop:RealisationCommutesWithFiniteProducts}), the realisation functor
	\begin{equation*}
		|\blank|\simeq \colimit_{\IDelta_\mathrm{inj}^\op}\colon \Fun(\IDelta_\mathrm{inj}^\op,\An)\morphism \An
	\end{equation*}
	for semi-simplicial anima doesn't commute with finite products in general. For example $\snake{\Delta}^0\times \snake{\Delta}^1\simeq\snake{\Delta}^0\sqcup \snake{\Delta}^1$, so $|\snake{\Delta}^0\times \snake{\Delta}^1|\simeq|\snake{\Delta}^0|\sqcup |\snake{\Delta}^1|$. But it does if one object is constant, since both $|X\times \const -|\colon \An\morphism \An$ and $|X|\times -\colon \An\morphism \An$ preserve colimits and agree on $*\in\An$, hence they must agree by \cref{thm:ColimitPreservingRepresentable}.
\end{smallwarn}
\refstepcounter{smallerdummy}
\numpar*{\thesmallerdummy. Edgewise Subdivision}\label{par:edgewiseSubdivision}
Let's give another construction of $k(\Cc)$ using the Quillen $Q$-construction from \cref{par:QuillenQConstruction}. To get a relation between the $Q$- and the $S$-construction, consider
\begin{align*}
	\IDelta^\op&\morphism \IDelta^\op\\
	[n]&\longmapsto [n]\star [n]^\op\,.
\end{align*}
It induces a functor $(-)^\mathrm{esd}\colon \cat{sAn}\morphism \cat{sAn}$, called \emph{edgewise subdivision}. For example, by \cref{lem:NrTwAr}, \begin{equation*}
	\N^r(\Cc)^\mathrm{esd}\simeq \N^r\big(\TwAr(\Cc^\op)\big)
\end{equation*}
holds for all $\infty$-categories $\Cc$. Moreover, we have
\begin{equation*}
	|X|\simeq |X^\mathrm{esd}|
\end{equation*}
for all simplicial anima $X$. Indeed, both sides are colimit preserving functors $\cat{sAn}\morphism \An$, hence it suffices to check that they coincide on simplices by \cref{thm:ColimitPreservingRepresentable}. Clearly $|\Delta^n|\simeq *$. To get the same for $(\Delta^n)^\mathrm{esd}$, we use $\N^r([n])\simeq \Delta^n$ (see before \cref{thmdef:RezkNerve}) and thus $(\Delta^n)^\mathrm{esd}\simeq \N^r(\TwAr([n]^\op))$ by the formula above. But $\TwAr([n]^\op)$ has an initial object, hence its realisation is contractible too.

Abstractly, $[n]^\op\star[n]= [2n+1]$. But rather than as the poset $(0<1<\dotsb<2n+1)$, we think of $[n]^\op\star[n]$ as the poset
\begin{equation*}
	(0_\ell < 1_\ell < \dotsb < n_\ell < n_r < (n-1)_r < \dotsb < 0_r)\,,
\end{equation*}
where the indices $(-)_\ell$ and $(-)_r$ indicate the \enquote{left} and \enquote{right} part, corresponding to $[n]$ and $[n]^\op$ respectively.

\begin{prop}\label{prop:QvsS}
	The map $\TwAr\big([n]^\op)\morphism \Ar([n]\star [n]^\op)$ sending $(i\leq j)$ to $(i_\ell\leq j_r)$
	induces an equivalence
	\begin{equation*}
		S(\Cc)^\mathrm{esd}\isomorphism Q(\Cc)
	\end{equation*}
	for any stable $\infty$-category $\Cc$. In particular, $k(\Cc)\simeq \Omega\left|\Span(\Cc)\right|$, where we put $\Span(\Cc)\simeq \asscat(\core Q(\Cc))$, as defined in \cref{propdef:SpanQ}.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
	It's easy to check that $\TwAr\big([n]^\op)\morphism \Ar([n]\star [n]^\op)$ defines a map of simplicial posets and that the induced map upon taking $\Fun(-,\Cc)$ restricts to a map $S(\Cc)^\mathrm{esd}\morphism Q(\Cc)$, as required.
	
	To show that this map is indeed an equivalence, we draw a picture in the case $n=2$, that is, a picture of $\Ar([2]\star [2]^\op)\simeq \Ar([5])$:

		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}
	We let $I_n$ denote the image of $\TwAr([n]^\op)\morphism \Ar([n]\star[n]^\op)$. This is the yellow part in the picture. Also let $\Delta_n^\ell$ and $\Delta_n^r$ be the subposets spanned by $\{(0_\ell\leq 0_\ell),\dotsc,(n_\ell\leq n_\ell)\}$ and $\{(n_r,n_r),\dotsc,(0_r,0_r)\}$, respectively. In the picture these are coloured pink and purple. Finally, let $J_n$ be the subposet spanned by $\left\{(i_\ell\leq j_\ell), (i_\ell\leq j_r)\st i\leq j\right\}$. This is the dotted part in the picture.
	
	By definition, an element lies in $S_{2n+1}(\Cc)$ iff all squares go to pushouts/pullbacks in the stable $\infty$-category $\Cc$. Moreover, $Q_n(\Cc)\subseteq \Fun(I_n,\Cc)$ is the full sub-$\infty$-category of those functors that send all squares in $I_n$ to pushouts/pullbacks. Now consider the composition
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\Fun(I_n,\Cc)\dar["\Lan"']\ar[rr,dashed] & &\Fun\big(\Ar([n]\star [n]^\op),\Cc\big)\\
			 \Fun(I_n\cup\Delta_n^\ell,\Cc)\rar["\Ran"] & \Fun(I_n\cup\Delta^n\cup\Delta_n^r,\Cc)\rar["\Ran"] & \Fun(J_n\cup\Delta_n^r,\Cc)\uar["\Lan"']
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	(where \enquote{$\cup$} always means that we take the full subposet spanned by the union). That is, we start with the yellow part, left-Kan extend to the pink part, right-Kan extend to the purple part, right-Kan extend to the dotted part, and the left-Kan extend to all of $\Ar([n]\star [n]^\op)$. All of these Kan extensions are along fully faithful embeddings of subposets, hence fully faithful by \cref{cor:FullyFaithfulKanExtension}. Breaking up each of the Kan extensions into a sequence of Kan extensions by adding one vertex at a time, and using the formulas from \cref{thm:KanExtension}, we verify that the essential image of $Q_n\subseteq \Fun(I_n,\Cc)$ is precisely $S_{2n+1}(\Cc)\subseteq \Fun(\Ar([n]\star [n]^\op),\Cc)$, which is what we want.
	
	For the \enquote{in particular}, note that $\left|\core S(\Cc)\right|\simeq |\core S(\Cc)^\mathrm{esd}|\simeq \left|\core Q(\Cc)\right|$ holds by \labelcref{par:edgewiseSubdivision} and what we've shown so far, and $\left|\core Q(\Cc)\right|\simeq \left|\Span(\Cc)\right|$ follows from \cref{rem:Realisation}.
\end{proof}
\subsection{The Resolution Theorem}
\cref{prop:QvsS} allows us to define a map $\core(\Cc)\morphism k(\Cc)$ via
\begin{equation*}
	\core(\Cc)\simeq \Hom_{\Span(\Cc)}(0,0)\morphism \Hom_{\left|\Span(\Cc)\right|}(0,0)\simeq \Omega \left|\Span(\Cc)\right|
\end{equation*}
(the equivalence on the left follows from \cref{eq:asscat2} applied to $\Span(\Cc)\simeq \asscat(\core Q(\Cc))$ and some playing around with the pullback involved). This morphism is clearly natural in $\Cc$, hence it defines a natural transformation $\core\Rightarrow k$ in $\Fun(\Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st},\An)$. But both functors preserve finite products (because they are built from right adjoints, except for the realisation $|\blank|$, but this also preserves finite products by \cref{prop:RealisationCommutesWithFiniteProducts}). Hence it lifts canonically to a natural transformation
\begin{equation*}
	(\core \Longrightarrow k)\colon \Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st}\morphism \CMon(\An)
\end{equation*}
by \cref{thm:CMonCGrpAdjunctions} and the following observation:
\begin{obs}\label{obs:CatStSemiAdditive}
	$\Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st}$ is semi-additive \embrace{and the same is true for $\Cat_\infty^\sqcup$, $\Cat_\infty^\times$, and $\Cat_\infty^\mathrm{semi\mhyph add}$}.
\end{obs}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
	Evidently, $\Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st}$ inherits products from $\Cat_\infty$, and the zero category $0\in \Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st}$ is a zero object. Next, recall \cref{prop:CocartesianMonoidalStructure}, which associates to every $\infty$-category $\Cc$ an $\infty$-operad $\Cc^\sqcup\morphism \IGamma^\op$. If you stare at the construction, you'll find it is clearly functorial in $\Cc$, hence we get a functor
	\begin{equation*}
		(-)^\sqcup\colon \Cat_\infty\morphism \Op_\infty\,.
	\end{equation*}
	But if $\Cc$ is stable, then it has finite coproducts and thus $\Cc^\sqcup\morphism \IGamma^\op$ is a symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category. Moreover, any map $F\colon \Cc\morphism\Dd$ in $\Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st}$ preserves finite coproducts, so its image  $F^\sqcup\colon \Cc^\sqcup\morphism\Dd^\sqcup$ is strongly monoidal. Hence $(-)^\sqcup$ restricts to a functor
	\begin{equation*}
		(-)^\oplus\colon \Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st}\morphism\CMon(\Cat_\infty)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	From this, we can extract functors $\oplus_\Cc\colon \Cc\times \Cc\morphism \Cc$ in $\Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st}$ which assemble into a natural transformation $\oplus\colon \Delta\Rightarrow \id$ in $\Fun(\Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st},\Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st})$ with the properties from  \cref{lem:SemiAddCriterion}. Hence that lemma implies that $\Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st}$ is semi-additive. The other cases are similar.
\end{proof}
\refstepcounter{smallerdummy}
\numpar*{\thesmallerdummy}\label{par:ProjRKDperRComparisonMap}
So for all stable $\infty$-categories $\Cc$ we get a map of $\IE_\infty$-monoids $\core(\Cc)\morphism k(\Cc)$. But $k(\Cc)$ is an $\IE_\infty$-group (because $\pi_0(k(\Cc))=K_0(\Cc)$ is an ordinary abelian group), hence this map factors over an $\IE_\infty$-group map
\begin{equation*}
	\core(\Cc)^\inftygrp\morphism k(\Cc)\,.
\end{equation*}
In particular, via $\Proj(R)\subseteq \core\Dd^\perf(R)$ this gives a map
\begin{equation*}
	k(R)\simeq \Proj(R)^\inftygrp\morphism \big(\core \Dd^\perf(R)\big)^\inftygrp \morphism k\big(\Dd^\perf(R)\big)\,.
\end{equation*}
And this map turns out to be an equivalence! Thereby we've reduced algebraic $K$-theory of rings, as constructed in \cref{def:AlgebraicKTheory}, to the more general construction from \cref{def:KTheoryOfStableInftyCategories}.

In fact, the equivalence $\Proj(R)^\inftygrp\simeq k(\Dd^\perf(R))$ can be proved in much more generality, but this needs a bit more terminology.
\numpar{Weight Structures*}\label{par:WeightStructure}
We didn't introduce this in the lecture, but here's what Fabian told the audience in his talk in Regensburg. A \emph{weight structure} on a stable $\infty$-category consists of two full sub-$\infty$-categories $\Cc_{\leq 0},\Cc_{\geq 0}\subseteq \Cc$ subject to the following conditions:
\begin{alphanumerate}
	\item $\Cc_{\geq 0}$ is closed under pushouts, $\Cc_{\leq 0}$ is closed under pullbacks, and both are closed under retracts.
	\item If $x\in \Cc_{\leq 0}$ and $y\in \Cc_{\geq 0}$, then the spectrum $\hom_\Cc(x,y)$ is connective (i.e.\ its homotopy groups vanish in negative degrees).
	\item For all $y\in \Cc$ there is a fibre sequence $x\morphism y\morphism z$ with $x\in \Cc_{\leq 0}$ and $z\in \Cc_{\geq 1}$. Here we put $\Cc_{\geq a}\coloneqq (\Cc_{\geq 0})[a]$ and $\Cc_{\leq b}\coloneqq (\Cc_{\leq 0})[b]$.
\end{alphanumerate}
We also put $\Cc_{[a,b]}\coloneqq \Cc_{\geq a}\cap \Cc_{\leq b}$, and $\Cc^\heartsuit\coloneqq \Cc_{[0,0]}=\Cc_{\geq 0}\cap \Cc_{\leq 0}$. A weight structure on $\Cc$ is called \emph{exhaustive} if
\begin{equation*}
	\Cc=\bigcup_{n\in\IN}\Cc_{[-n,n]}\,.
\end{equation*}
Fabian remarks that the notion of a weight structure is different from that of a $t$-structure (which you might know from \cite[Definition~\HAthm{1.2.1.4}]{HA}). For example, in a $t$-structure the roles of \enquote{$\leq$} and \enquote{$\geq$} in \itememph{c} would be swapped. You should think of $t$-structures as generalisations of \enquote{smart} truncation of chain complexes, whereas a weight structure behaves more like \enquote{stupid} truncation. In particular, the fibre sequence in $\Cc$ is highly non-canonical, whereas in a $t$-structure there's always a canonical choice using the truncation functors. Moreover, the heart of a $t$-structure is always an abelian category, whereas it need not even be a $1$-category for a weight structure.

Note that \itememph{a} implies that both $\Cc_{\geq 0}$ and $\Cc_{\leq 0}$ contain $0$, since it is a retract of everything (and both sub-$\infty$-categories are non-empty by \itememph{c}), and both are closed under finite direct sums. To acquaint myself a bit more with weight structures, let me also list the following further properties:
\begin{lem*}\label{lem*:MoreOnHearts}
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item An object $x\in \Cc$ lies in $\Cc_{\leq 0}$ iff $\hom_\Cc(x,y)$ is connective for all $y\in \Cc_{\geq 0}$. Similarly, $y\in \Cc$ lies in $\Cc_{\geq 0}$ iff $\hom_\Cc(x,y)$ is connective for all $x\in \Cc_{\leq 0}$.
		\item Both $\Cc_{\geq 0}$ and $\Cc_{\leq 0}$ are closed under extensions. That is, if the outer two terms in a fibre sequence lie in $\Cc_{\geq 0}$, then the same is true for the inner term, and likewise for  $\Cc_{\leq 0}$.
		\item $\Cc^\heartsuit$ is an additive $\infty$-category, and every fibre sequence $x\morphism y\morphism z$ in $\Cc$ splits if all of its terms lie in $\Cc^\heartsuit$.
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{lem*}
\begin{proof*}
	For \itememph{a}, we only do the second case since the first one is analogous. The \enquote{only if} holds by assumption. So assume $y\in\Cc$ satisfies that $\hom_\Cc(x,y)$ is connective for all $x\in \Cc_{\leq 0}$. Apply \cref{par:WeightStructure}\itememph{c} to $y[1]$ to get a fibre sequence $x\morphism y\morphism z$ with $x\in \Cc_{\leq -1}$ and $z\in \Cc_{\geq 0}$. Then $\pi_0\hom_\Cc(x,y)=\pi_{-1}\hom_\Cc(x[1],y)=0$ by \cref{par:WeightStructure}\itememph{b}. Hence the long exact homotopy groups sequence associated to the fibre sequence $\hom_\Cc(z,y)\morphism \hom_\Cc(y,y)\morphism\hom_\Cc(x,y)$ in spectra becomes
	\begin{equation*}
		\dotso\morphism \pi_0\hom_\Cc(z,y)\morphism \pi_0\hom_\Cc(y,y)\morphism 0\,.
	\end{equation*}
	In particular, $\pi_0\hom_\Cc(z,y)\morphism \pi_0\hom_\Cc(y,y)$ is surjective. Choosing a preimage of $\id_y$ witnesses $y$ as a retract of $z$, hence $y\in \Cc_{\geq 0}$ because it is closed under retracts. This shows \itememph{a}. Part~\itememph{b} is an immediate consequence of \itememph{a} and the long exact homotopy groups sequence.
	
	It's clear that $\Cc^\heartsuit$ is contains $0$ and is closed under finite direct sums (in fact, under fibre sequences by \itememph{b}), hence it inherits additivity from $\Cc$. If $x\morphism y\morphism z$ is a fibre sequence in $\Cc$ whose terms lie in $\Cc^\heartsuit$, then $\hom_\Cc(z,x)\morphism \hom_\Cc(z,y)\morphism\hom_\Cc(z,z)$ is a fibre sequence in spectra. But all of its entries are connective, hence the long exact sequence of homotopy groups reads
	\begin{equation*}
		\dotso\morphism \pi_0\hom_\Cc(z,x)\morphism \pi_0\hom_\Cc(z,y)\morphism \pi_0\hom_\Cc(z,z)\morphism 0\,.
	\end{equation*}
	In particular, $\pi_0\hom_\Cc(z,y)\morphism \pi_0\hom_\Cc(z,z)$ is surjective, whence we get a split $z\morphism y$ by choosing a preimage of $\id_z$. Now consider the diagram
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			0 \rar\dar\drar[dotted,pushout] & x \rar\dar\drar[pushout] & 0\dar\\
			z \rar & y\rar & z
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	The right square is a pushout by assumption, and the outer rectangle is a pushout too since $z\morphism y\morphism z$ is equivalent to the identity on $z$. Hence the left square is a pushout as well, which establishes $y\simeq x\oplus z$.
\end{proof*}
The prime example of an exhaustive weight structure is $\Dd^\perf(R)$ for a ring $R$, with
\begin{equation*}
	\Dd^\perf(R)_{[a,b]}=\left\{C\in\Dd^\perf(R)\st\begin{tabular}{c}
		$C$ has a projective representative\\
		concentrated in degrees $[a,b]$
	\end{tabular}\right\}\,.
\end{equation*}
Note that this is stronger than heaving homology concentrated in degrees $[a,b]$! The heart of this weight structure is $\Dd^\perf(R)^\heartsuit\simeq\Proj(R)$.  With this, we can formulate a general version of the \enquote{resolution theorem}, also often called the \enquote{weight version of the theorem of the heart}.
\begin{thm}[Resolution theorem, Gillet--Waldhausen]\label{thm:Resolution}
	If $\Cc$ is a stable $\infty$-category equipped with an exhaustive weight structure, then composing $\core(\Cc^\heartsuit)^\inftygrp\morphism \core(\Cc)^\inftygrp$ with the map from \textup{\labelcref{par:ProjRKDperRComparisonMap}} induces an equivalence
	\begin{equation*}
		\core(\Cc^\heartsuit)^\inftygrp\morphism k(\Cc)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	In particular, $k(R)\simeq \Proj(R)^\inftygrp\simeq k(\Dd^\perf(R))$ for every ring $R$.
\end{thm}
We won't prove \cref{thm:Resolution}. But Fabian has promised he will sketch a new proof due to Wolfgang Steimle and himself in the official notes. In fact, they proved an even more general statement about \emph{Poincaré categories}, which Fabian will also introduce in his notes.
\section{\texorpdfstring{$K$}{K}-Theory as the Universal Additive Invariant}
\lecture[Lots of terminology named after Verdier. Recollements. The additivity theorem.\newline --- \emph{\enquote{Today there will be a definition that's longer than a page, and then a theorem that's longer than a page, and the theorem will essentially be trivial.}}]{2021-02-04}Our next goal is to analyse the functor $k\colon \Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st}\morphism \CGrp(\An)$, and in particular to prove the following result from \cite{BlumbergGepnerTabuada}:
\begin{thm}\label{thm:K=coreGrp}
	The inclusion $\Fun^{\grp}(\Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st},\CGrp(\An))\subseteq\Fun^\mathrm{add}(\Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st},\An)$ admits a left adjoint $(-)^\grp\simeq \Omega|\Span^{(-)}(-)|$, and 
	\begin{equation*}
		k\simeq \core^\grp\,.
	\end{equation*}
	In other words, $K$-theory is the initial grouplike functor under $\core\colon \Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st}\morphism \An$.
\end{thm}
The proof of \cref{thm:K=coreGrp} has to wait till page~\labelcpageref{page:ProofOfBlumbergGepnerTabuada}. Let's start with explaining all that new terminology in it, and to do that, we'll introduce even more.

\begin{defi}\label{def:VerdierStuff}
	Let's define things named after Verdier:
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item A \emph{Verdier sequence} is a sequence $\Aa\morphism\Bb\morphism\Cc$ in $\Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st}$ that is both a fibre and a cofibre sequence. It is called \emph{left/right split} if both functors admit left/right adjoints, and \emph{split} if it is both left and right split (so all four possible adjoints exist).
		\item A functor $\Bb\morphism\Cc$ participating in a Verdier sequence as in \itememph{a} is called a \emph{Verdier projection}, and similarly $\Aa\morphism\Bb$ is called a \emph{Verdier injection}. A Verdier projection or injection is called \emph{left/right split} if the corresponding Verdier sequence has that property.
		\item A \emph{Verdier square} is a pullback square in $\Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st}$
		\begin{equation*}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				\Aa\dar\rar\drar[pullback] &\Bb\dar\\
				\Cc\rar & \Dd
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{equation*}
		such that the vertical maps are Verdier projections. A Verdier square is called \emph{\embrace{left/right} split} if the Verdier projections have the respective property.
	\end{alphanumerate}
	Moreover, functor $F \colon \Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st}\morphism \Ee$, where $\Ee$ has finite limits, is \emph{additive} or \emph{Verdier-localising} if it takes split Verdier squares or all Verdier squares to pullback squares in $\Ee$. It is called \emph{Karoubi-localising} if it is Verdier-localising and takes dense inclusions to equivalences. The corresponding full sub-$\infty$-categories of $\Fun(\Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st},\Ee)$ are denoted
	\begin{equation*}
		\Fun^\mathrm{Kar}(\Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st},\Ee)\subseteq \Fun^\mathrm{Verd}(\Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st},\Ee)\subseteq \Fun^\add(\Catst,\Ee)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Finally, an additive functor $F\colon\Catst\morphism \Ee$ is called \emph{grouplike} if it factors over $\CGrp(\Ee)$ (the factorisation is automatically canonical, see \cref{par:MoreOnVerdierSequences}\itememph{c}). The corresponding full sub-$\infty$-category is denoted
	\begin{equation*}
		\Fun^\grp(\Catst,\Ee)\subseteq \Fun^\add(\Catst,\Ee)\,.
	\end{equation*}
\end{defi}
\numpar{More on Verdier Sequences and Additive Functors}\label{par:MoreOnVerdierSequences}
Having introduced a plethora of new terminology in \cref{def:VerdierStuff}, some explanations are in order.
\begin{alphanumerate}
	\item The functor categories $\Fun(\Catst,\Ee)$ are usually not locally small. But we'll ignore set-theoretic issues in the following.
	\item In $\Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st}$ it is really a \emph{property} (rather than a structure) to be  a Verdier sequence: Given $\Aa\morphism \Bb\morphism\Cc$, an extension to
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\Aa\dar\rar &\Bb\dar\\
			0\rar & \Cc
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	is unique (up to contractible choice) because $0\in \Fun(\Aa,\Cc)$ is initial and terminal.
	\item Because $\Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st}$ is semi-additive by \cref{obs:CatStSemiAdditive}, we obtain that
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\Aa\times \Cc\dar\rar\drar[pullback] &\Cc\dar\\
			\Aa\rar & 0
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	is always a split Verdier square. Moreover, $\Cc\morphism \Cc\morphism 0$ is always a split Verdier sequence, and so is $\Cc\morphism \Aa\times \Cc\morphism \Aa$ in general. Hence additive functors preserve finite products. But then \cref{thm:CMonCGrpAdjunctions} implies that
	\begin{equation*}
		\Fun^\add(\Catst,\Ee)\simeq \Fun^\add\big(\Catst,\CMon(\Ee)\big)\simeq \CMon\big(\Fun^\add(\Catst,\Ee)\big)
	\end{equation*}
	for any $\infty$-category $\Ee$ with finite limits. Thus $\Fun^\grp(\Catst,\Ee)\subseteq \Fun^\add(\Catst,\Ee)$ as defined in \cref{def:VerdierStuff} makes sense, and also
	\begin{equation*}
		\Fun^\grp(\Catst,\Ee)\simeq \Fun^\add\big(\Catst,\CGrp(\Ee)\big)\simeq \CGrp\big(\Fun^\add(\Catst,\Ee)\big)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Moreover, the arguments above show that $\Fun^\add(\Catst,\Ee)$ is semi-additive, and thus the same is true for $\Fun^\grp(\Catst,\Ee)$, $\Fun^\Verd(\Catst,\Ee)$, and $\Fun^\Kar(\Catst,\Ee)$. Finally, all of them are closed under limits in $\Fun(\Catst,\Ee)$.
	\item[\itememph{d^*}] If $F\colon \Catst\morphism \An$ is a grouplike additive functor, then $F(\Bb)\simeq F(A)\times F(\Cc)$ for every split Verdier sequence $\Aa\morphism \Bb\morphism \Cc$. Indeed, $F(\Aa)\morphism F(\Bb)\morphism F(\Cc)$ is a fibre sequence in $\An$, hence also in $\CGrp(\An)\subseteq \Sp$, and either of the fully faithful adjoints $\Cc\morphism \Bb$ induces a split $F(\Cc)\morphism F(\Bb)$. But any such fibre sequence in $\Sp$ must be split, using the same argument as in the proof of \cref{lem*:MoreOnHearts}.
	\item[\itememph{e}] An example of a Verdier-localising but not grouplike functor is $\core\colon \Catst\morphism \An$. It is Verdier-localising simply because it takes arbitrary pullbacks (and not just Verdier squares) to pullbacks in $\An$.
	
	Here we should probably mention that $\Catst\subseteq \Cat_\infty$ is closed under pullbacks (and in fact, arbitrary finite limits). To see this, first note that $\Catst\subseteq\Cat_\infty^\mathrm{lex}$ has both adjoints by \cref{thm:SpLeftAdjoint} and the remark after it. Hence it suffices that $\Cat_\infty^\mathrm{lex}\subseteq \Cat_\infty$ is closed under pullbacks. But if we are given a pullback diagram in $\Cat_\infty$ such that both legs preserve finite limits, then any finite limit in the pullback can be computed componentwise (and in particular, exists if it exists componentwise).

\numpar*{\thesmallerdummy. Fibre Sequences in $\Catst$}\label{par:FibreSequencesInCatSt}
We can explicitly characterise fibre sequences in $\Catst$. Given an exact functor $p\colon \Bb\morphism \Cc$ between stable $\infty$-categories, the fibre $\fib(p)$ is the full subcategory
\begin{equation*}
	\fib(p)\simeq \left\{b\in \Bb\st p(b)\simeq 0\text{ in $\Cc$}\right\}\subseteq \Bb\,.
\end{equation*}
Since $p$ is exact, it's easy to show that $\fib(p)\subseteq \Bb$ is closed under finite direct sums and fibre/cofibre sequences, hence it is really a stable sub-$\infty$-category, and one immediately checks that $\fib(p)$ also satisfies the desired universal property.
\refstepcounter{smallerdummy}
\numpar*{\thesmallerdummy. Cofibre Sequences in $\Catst$}\label{par:CofibreSequencesInCatSt}
There's also an explicit description of cofibres in $\Catst$. Given an exact functor $f\colon \Aa\morphism\Bb$, by the \emph{essential image} of $f$ we mean the full sub-$\infty$-category of $\Bb$ spanned by all objects which are equivalent to some $f(a)$. Since $f$ is exact, the essential image is closed under finite direct sums, but not necessarily under fibres and cofibres, since there might be more morphisms in $\Bb$ than in $\Aa$. But there's always a smallest stable sub-$\infty$-category of $\Bb$ containing the essential image of $f$. In any case, we have
\begin{equation*}
	\cofib(f)\simeq \Bb/\Aa\coloneqq \Bb\big[\{\text{mod-$\Aa$ equivalences}\}^{-1}\big]\,,
\end{equation*}
where the mod-$\Aa$ equivalences are all those maps $\phi\colon x\morphism y$ whose fibre/cofibre is a retract of an object in the stable sub-$\infty$-category generated by the essential image of $f$. As $\fib(\phi)\simeq \cofib(\phi)[-1]$, it really suffices to assume that either one is such a retract.

In contrast to \itememph{c}, it's not so easy to show that $\cofib(f)\simeq \Bb/\Aa$ is a stable $\infty$-category again and that $\Bb\morphism \Bb/\Aa$ is an exact functor, so we'll postpone the proof for the moment. But assuming this is true, it's easy to check that $\Bb/\Aa$ is indeed the correct cofibre: Let $\Cc$ be another stable $\infty$-category. By definition (see \cref{exm:Localisation}),
\begin{equation*}
	\Hom_{\Catst}(\Bb/\Aa,\Cc)\subseteq \Hom_{\Catst}(\Bb,\Cc)
\end{equation*}
is the collection of path components of functors that invert mod-$\Aa$ equivalences. But note that also
\begin{equation*}
	\Hom_{\Catst}\big(\cofib(f),\Cc\big)\simeq \Hom_{\Catst}(\Bb,\Cc)\times_{\Hom_{\Catst}(\Aa,\Cc)}\{0\}\subseteq \Hom_{\Catst}(\Bb,\Cc)
\end{equation*}
is also a collection of path components. This is because the zero functor is initial (and terminal) in $\Fun(\Aa,\Cc)$, hence its path component in $\Hom_{\Catst}(\Aa,\Cc)\subseteq \core \Fun(\Aa,\Cc)$ is a contractible anima, hence the inclusion of $\{0\}$ into it is an equivalence.

Therefore, it suffices to show $\Hom_{\Catst}(\Bb/\Aa,\Cc)$ and $\Hom_{\Catst}(\cofib(f),\Cc)$ comprise the same path components. But that's easy: Any exact functor $p\colon \Bb\morphism\Cc$ inverting the mod-$\Aa$ equivalences satisfies $p\circ f\simeq 0$, as $0\morphism p(a)$ is a mod-$\Aa$ equivalence for all $a\in \Aa$ Conversely, any exact $p\colon \Bb\morphism\Cc$ with $p\circ f\simeq 0$ also kills all retracts of the stable sub-$\infty$-category generated by the essential image of $f$. Hence it inverts mod-$\Aa$ equivalences.


\begin{thm}\label{thm:VerdierStuff}
	Let $F\colon \Aa\morphism\Bb$ be an exact functor of stable $\infty$-categories.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item $F$ is a Verdier projection iff it is a localisation. In this case it automatically inverts precisely the mod-$\fib(F)$ equivalences.
		\item $F$ is a left/right split Verdier projection iff it admits a fully faithful left/right adjoint \embrace{i.e., iff it is a left/right Bousfield localisation}.
		\item $F$ is a Verdier inclusion iff it is fully faithful and its essential image is closed under retracts in $\Bb$.
		\item $F$ is a left/right split Verdier inclusion iff it is fully faithful and has a left/right adjoint.
	\end{alphanumerate}
	Furthermore, if 
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\Aa\rar["f"'] & \Bb\rar["p"']\lar[dashed,bend right=45,"g"'] & \Cc\lar[dashed,bend right=45,"q"']
		\end{tikzcd}\quad\text{or}\quad \begin{tikzcd}
		\Aa\rar["f"] & \Bb\rar["p"]\lar[dashed,bend left=45,"g'"] & \Cc\lar[dashed,bend left=45,"q'"]
	\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	is a left or right split Verdier sequence, with adjoints as indicated, then for all $b\in \Bb$ there are fibre sequences $qp(b)\morphism b\morphism fg(b)$ or $fg'(b)\morphism b\morphism q'p(b)$, respectively. Moreover, in this case the sequences
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\Cc\rar["q"] & \Bb\rar["g"]\lar[dashed,bend left=45,"p"] & \Aa\lar[dashed,bend left=45,"f"]

	\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	are right or left split Verdier, respectively. Finally, if
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\Aa\rar["f"'] & \Bb\rar["p"']\lar[dashed,bend right=45,"g"']\lar[dashed,bend left=45,"g'"] & \Cc\lar[dashed,bend right=45,"q"']\lar[dashed,bend left=45,"q'"]
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	is a split Verdier sequence, then $gq'\simeq \cofib(q\Rightarrow q') \simeq \cofib(g'\Rightarrow g)\simeq g'q[1]$ \embrace{we'll explain in the proof how the middle two are functors $\Cc\morphism\Aa$}, and for all $b\in \Bb$ there are pushout/pullback squares
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			b\rar\dar\drar[pushout] & fg(b)\dar\\
			q'p(b)\rar & fgq'p(b)
		\end{tikzcd}\quad\text{and}\quad \begin{tikzcd}
		fg'qp(b)\rar\dar\drar[pushout] & fg'(b)\dar\\
		qp(b)\rar & b
	\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof*}
	The proof is essentially trivial (assuming the description of cofibres in \labelcref{par:CofibreSequencesInCatSt}) and was left as an exercise in the lecture.
	
	We begin with \itememph{a}. Every Verdier projection is a localisation by \labelcref{par:CofibreSequencesInCatSt}, hence it suffices to prove the converse. If $\Bb\simeq \Aa[W^{-1}]$ for some $W\subseteq \pi_0\core\Ar(\Aa)$, then all morphisms $\phi\colon x\morphism y$ in $W$ satisfy $F(\fib(\phi))\simeq 0$ since $\phi$ is sent to an equivalence and $F$ is exact. Hence $W$ is contained in the mod-$\fib(F)$ equivalences. This might well be a proper inclusion. But every exact functor $\Bb\morphism \Cc$ automatically inverts all mod-$\fib(F)$ equivalences, hence also
	\begin{equation*}
		\Bb\simeq \Aa\big[\{\text{mod-$\fib(F)$ equiv.}\}^{-1}\big]
	\end{equation*}
	and thus $\fib(F)\morphism \Aa\morphism \Bb$ is also a cofibre sequence. Finally, the inverted morphisms are precisely the mod-$\fib(F)$ equivalences: Indeed, if $F(\phi)$ is an equivalence in $\Bb$ for some $\phi\colon x\morphism y$ in $\Aa$, then $F(\fib(\phi))\simeq 0$, hence $\fib(\phi)\in \fib(F)$.
	
	Next, we prove \itememph{b}. \cref{propdef:BousfieldLocalisation} and \cref{prop:LocalisationBousfield} take care of most of the statement, and all that's left is to show that if $F\colon \Aa\morphism \Bb$ is a left/right Bousfield localisation, then $\fib(F)\subseteq \Aa$ has a left/right adjoint. Let's only do the left case; the right case is entirely analogous. Let $q\colon \Bb\morphism \Aa$ be a left adjoint, with counit $c\colon qF\Rightarrow \id_\Aa$. We claim that $g\simeq  \cofib(c\colon qF\Rightarrow \id_\Aa)$ defines a left adjoint $g\colon \Aa\morphism \fib(F)$ of the fully faithful inclusion $\fib(F)\subseteq \Aa$.
	
	First off, $F(g(a))\simeq \cofib(\id_{F(a)}\colon F(a)\morphism F(a))\simeq 0$ since $F$ is exact, hence $g$ takes values in the full sub-$\infty$-category $\fib(F)$, as required. We must show that $g$ is a left Bousfield localisation onto $\fib(F)$, so of course we'll apply our favourite criterion, Proposition~\labelcref{prop:LLaddendum}. We get a natural transformation $\eta\colon \id_\Aa\Rightarrow g$ for free, since $g$ was defined as a cofibre. It's easy to see that $\eta_{g(a)}\colon g(a)\isomorphism g(g(a))$ is an equivalence for all $a\in \Aa$. Indeed, $qF(g(a))\simeq 0$, hence
	\begin{equation*}
		g\big(g(a)\big)\simeq \cofib\big(c_{g(a)}\colon qF(g(a))\rightarrow g(a)\big)\simeq g(a)\,,
	\end{equation*}
	as required. Proving that $g(\eta_{a})\colon g(a)\isomorphism g(g(a))$ is an equivalence is only slightly harder: We have get a morphism of cofibre sequences
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			qF(a)\rar\dar["qF(\eta_a)"']\drar[pushout] & a\dar["\eta_a"] \rar &g(a)\dar[iso,"g(\eta_a)"']\\
			qF\big(g(a)\big)\rar & g(a)\rar & g\big(g(a)\big)
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	But $qF(g(a))\simeq 0$, hence the square on the left is a pushout as indicated, which implies that the induced map on cofibres must be an equivalence. Thus Proposition~\labelcref{prop:LLaddendum} can be applied, which shows that $g$ is a left Bousfield localisation with image in $\fib(F)$. But $\eta$ is an equivalence on all of $\fib(F)$, hence the image of $g$ is all of it. This shows \itememph{b}.
	
	The \enquote{only if} part of \itememph{c} is clear from our description of fibres in \labelcref{par:FibreSequencesInCatSt}. Conversely, assume $F$ is fully faithful and its essential image is closed under retracts. We must show that $\Aa$ is the fibre of $\Bb\morphism \Bb/\Aa$. This can be verified on homotopy categories. So assume $b\in \Bb$ has the property that the unique morphism $0\morphism b$ in $\pi\Bb$ becomes an equivalence in the localisation
	\begin{equation*}
		\pi(\Bb/\Aa)\simeq (\pi\Bb)\big[\{\text{mod-$\Aa$ equiv.}\}^{-1}\big]\,.
	\end{equation*}
	We must show that $b$ lies in (the essential image of) $\pi\Aa$. Usually, such a question is notoriously difficult, but here we are lucky. By assumption on $\Bb$, a morphism $\phi\colon x\morphism y$ in $\Bb$ is a mod-$\Aa$ equivalence iff $\fib(\phi)$ lies in (the essential image of) $\Aa$. Using this, it's not hard to verify that the mod-$\Aa$ equivalences form a \emph{left multiplicative system} in $\pi\Bb$ in the sense of \cite[\stackstag{04VB}]{stacks-project}. In such a situation, the localisation is easy to describe. Since we assume that the identity $\id_b\colon b\morphism b$ and the zero morphism $0\colon b\morphism b$ coincide in $\pi(\Bb/\Aa)$, there must be a commutative diagram
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			& b\eqar[dr]\dar & \\
			b\eqar[ur]\drar["0"]\rar & c& b\lar["s"']\\
			& b\uar\eqar[ur]& 
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	in $\pi\Bb$, where $s$ is a mod-$\Aa$ equivalence. But a simple diagram chase shows $s=0$. Hence $\fib(s)\simeq b\oplus c[1]$ is in contained in (the essential image of) $\Aa$, and thus so is $b$ by closedness under retracts.
	
	For~\itememph{d}, the \enquote{only if} is trivial from \itememph{c} and the definitions. So assume $F$ is fully faithful with left adjoint $g\colon \Bb\morphism \Aa$ and unit $\eta\colon \id_\Bb\Rightarrow Fg$. In the same way as in \itememph{b}, we prove that $p\simeq \fib(\eta\colon \id_\Bb\Rightarrow Fg)$ is a right Bousfield localisation $p\colon \Bb\morphism\Bb$ onto the full sub-$\infty$-category $\im(p)\subseteq \Bb$. By the dual of \cref{propdef:BousfieldLocalisation}\itememph{d}, $\im(p)$ is a localisation at those morphisms $\phi\colon x\morphism y$ for which 
	\begin{equation*}
		\phi_*\colon \Hom_\Bb\big(p(b),x\big)\isomorphism \Hom_\Bb\big(p(b),y\big)
	\end{equation*}
	is an equivalence for all $b\in \Bb$. But this is equivalent to
	\begin{equation*}
		*\simeq \Hom_\Bb\big(p(b),\fib(\phi)\big)\simeq \Hom_{\im(p)}\big(p(b),p(\fib(\phi))\big)\,,
	\end{equation*}
	which is in turn equivalent to $p(\fib(\phi))\simeq 0$. This again is equivalent to $\fib(\phi)\isomorphism Fg(\fib(\phi))$ being an equivalence, or in other words, to $\fib(\phi)$ lying in the essential image of $\Aa$. Hence the localisation $p$ is a localisation at all those morphisms whose fibre is in the essential image of $\Aa$. But then it inverts all mod-$\Aa$ equivalences, hence $\im(p)\simeq \Bb/\Aa$ is the localisation we're looking for. This proves the left case of \itememph{d}. The right case is analogous.
	
	Now for the additional assertions. Assume that
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\Aa\rar["f"'] & \Bb\rar["p"']\lar[dashed,bend right=45,"g"'] & \Cc\lar[dashed,bend right=45,"q"']
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	is a left split Verdier sequence (the right case is analogous). The desired fibre sequences were already constructed in the proof of \itememph{b}. Let's show that
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\Cc\rar["q"] & \Bb\rar["g"]\lar[dashed,bend left=45,"p"] & \Aa\lar[dashed,bend left=45,"f"]
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	is a right split Verdier sequence. We already know from \itememph{d} that $q$ is a right split Verdier inclusion, so we only need to check that $\Aa$ is its cofibre. By \cref{propdef:BousfieldLocalisation}\itememph{d}, $\Aa$ is a localisation of $\Bb$ at the $f$-local equivalences, i.e.\ at those morphisms $\phi\colon x\morphism y$ for which
	\begin{equation*}
		\phi^*\colon \Hom_\Bb\big(y,f(a)\big)\isomorphism \Hom_\Bb\big(x,f(a)\big)
	\end{equation*}
	is an equivalence for all $a\in\Aa$. Dualising the argument from the proof of \itememph{d}, this is equivalent to $\cofib(\phi)$ lying in the image of $\Cc$, hence the $f$-local equivalences coincide with the mod-$\Cc$ equivalences (here we also use that $q$ is fully faithful and its essential image is closed under retracts by \itememph{c}). This shows that indeed $\Aa\simeq \cofib(q)$.
	
	Finally, suppose
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\Aa\rar["f"'] & \Bb\rar["p"']\lar[dashed,bend right=45,"g"']\lar[dashed,bend left=45,"g'"] & \Cc\lar[dashed,bend right=45,"q"']\lar[dashed,bend left=45,"q'"]
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	is a split Verdier sequence. By adjunction, constructing a natural transformation $q\Rightarrow q'$ is equivalent to constructing a natural transformation $pq\Rightarrow \id_\Cc$. But the unit $\eta\colon \id_\Cc\Rightarrow pq$ is an equivalence, hence we can take its inverse. Now
	\begin{equation*}
		p\big(\cofib(q\Rightarrow q')\big)\simeq \cofib(pq\Rightarrow pq')\simeq \cofib(\id\colon \id_\Cc\Rightarrow\id_\Cc)\simeq 0\,,
	\end{equation*}
	hence $\cofib(q\Rightarrow q')\colon \Cc\morphism \Bb$ factors naturally over $\Aa$. Now recall the natural fibre sequences $qp(b)\morphism b\morphism fg(b)$, plug in $b\simeq q'(c)$ and use $pq'\simeq \id_\Cc$ to get $\cofib(q(c)\morphism q'(c))\simeq fgq'(c)$. Since everything is natural in $c$, this implies
	\begin{equation*}
		gq'\simeq \cofib(q\Rightarrow q')\text{ in }\Fun(\Cc,\Aa)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Moreover, plugging $b\simeq q(c)$ into the fibre sequences $fg'(b)\morphism b\morphism q'p(b)$ and using $pq\simeq \id_\Cc$ implies $fg'q(c)\simeq \fib(q(c)\morphism q'(c))\simeq \cofib(q(c)\morphism q'(c))[-1]$. This is natural in $c$, and moreover one checks that the morphisms $q(c)\morphism q'(c)$ are the same as above. Hence also
	\begin{equation*}
		gq'[1]\simeq \cofib(q\Rightarrow q')\text{ in }\Fun(\Cc,\Aa)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	To construct a natural transformation $g'\Rightarrow g$, we apply $g$ to the counit $fg'\Rightarrow \id_\Bb$ and use $gf\simeq \id_\Aa$. Now $gq\simeq 0$ and thus $\cofib(g'q\Rightarrow gq)\simeq g'q[1]$. Similarly, $g'q'\simeq 0$ and thus $\cofib(g'q'\Rightarrow gq')\simeq gq'$. But we already know $g'q[1]\simeq gq'$, hence 
	\begin{equation*}
		\cofib(g'q\Rightarrow gq) \simeq \cofib(g'q'\Rightarrow gq')\text{ in }\Fun(\Cc,\Aa)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	We call this functor simply $\cofib(g'\Rightarrow g)\colon \Cc\morphism \Aa$. Thereby we've obtained the desired equivalences $gq'\simeq \cofib(q\Rightarrow q') \simeq \cofib(g'\Rightarrow g)\simeq g'q[1]$.
	
	It remains to construct the pushout/pullback squares. Consider the following solid pushout/pullback diagram:
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\boldsymbol{?}[-1]\rar[dashed]\dar[dashed]\drar[pushout] & fg'(b)\dar\rar\drar[pushout] &0\dar\\
			qp(b)\rar \dar\drar[pushout] & b\rar\dar\drar[pushout] & q'p(b)\dar[dashed] \\
			0 \rar & fg(b)\rar[dashed] & \boldsymbol{?}
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	Plugging $b\simeq q'p(b')$ into the fibre sequence $qp(b)\morphism b\morphism fg(b)$ and using $pq'\simeq \id_\Cc$ shows that there is a fibre sequence $qp(b')\morphism q'p(b')\morphism fgq'p(b')$ for all $b'\in \Bb$. Upon inspection, the first arrow coincides with the horizontal composition in the middle row of the diagram. Hence $\boldsymbol{?}\simeq fgq'p(b)$, which establishes the first pullback square. Moreover, $fgq'p(b)[-1]\simeq f(gq'[-1])p(b)\simeq fg'qp(b)$, which establishes the second pullback square. We're done, at last.

\numpar*{\thesmallerdummy. Even More on Verdier Sequences}\label{par:EvenMoreOnVerdierSequences}
As a consequence of \cref{thm:VerdierStuff}\itememph{b} and \itememph{d},  for a Verdier sequence to be left/right split, it suffices that one of the two functors has a left/right adjoint. Moreover, for a pullback square
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}
		\Aa\dar\rar\drar[pullback] &\Bb\dar\\
		\Cc\rar & \Dd
	\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
in $\Catst$ to be a left/right split Verdier square, it suffices that the left vertical map $\Bb\morphism \Dd$ is a left/right split Verdier projection; we don't even need to assume that $\Aa\morphism\Cc$ is a Verdier projection at all. Indeed, if there is a fully faithful left/right adjoint $\Dd\morphism \Bb$, then we also get a fully faithful left/right adjoint $\Cc\morphism\Aa$ from the pullback property. Hence $\Aa\morphism \Cc$ is automatically a left/right split Verdier projection as well.

\end{equation*}
is also known as a \emph{stable recollement} (with French pronounciation), and $gq'$, or any of its three other equivalent descriptions from \cref{thm:VerdierStuff} is called its \emph{classifying functor} $c$. This is because one can check that

	\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
is the universal stable recollement with fibre $\Aa$. 

Let's look at an example. A map $f\colon R\morphism S$ is called a \emph{localisation} of $\IE_\infty$-rings if the multiplication map $\mu\colon  S\otimes_RS\isomorphism S$ is an equivalence. For example, we could take $HA\morphism HB$ for $A\morphism B$ a derived localisation of ordinary rings (see \cref{propdef:derivedLocalisation}, and \cref{prop:HStronglyMonoidal} for why derived localisations give localisations of $\IE_\infty$-ring spectra), or $R\morphism R[s^{-1}]$ for some $s\in\pi_0(R)$. In any case, we have the following lemma.
\begin{smalllem}\label{lem:LocalisationRecollement}
	For any localisation $f\colon R\morphism S$ of $\IE_\infty$-ring spectra, there is a stable recollement
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\Mod_S\rar["f^*"'] & \Mod_R\rar["{I\otimes_R-}"']\lar[dashed,bend right=45,"{S\otimes_R-}"']\lar[dashed,bend left=45,"{\hom_R(S,-)}"] & \Mod_R^{S\mhyph\mathrm{tors}}\lar[dashed,bend right=45,"\mathrm{incl.}"']\lar[dashed,bend left=45,"{\hom_R(I,-)}"]
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	where $f^*$ denotes the forgetful functor, $I\simeq \fib(f\colon R\morphism S)$, and $\Mod_R^{S\mhyph\mathrm{tors}}\subseteq \Mod_R$ denotes the full stable sub-$\infty$-category of those $R$-module spectra that die upon $S\otimes_R-$.
\end{smalllem}
\begin{proof*}
	We've seen in \labelcref{par:TensorHomInCAlg}\itememph{c} that $f^*$ has left adjoint $S\otimes_R-$ and right adjoint $\hom_R(S,-)$. Moreover, as $f\colon R\morphism S$ is a localisation, $f^*$ is fully faithful by \cref{propdef:derivedLocalisation}\itememph{b}. Note that this proposition/definition only deals with derived localisations of ordinary rings, but the proof can be copied verbatim for arbitrary localisations of $\IE_\infty$-ring spectra. Hence $f^*$ is a split Verdier inclusion by \cref{thm:VerdierStuff}\itememph{d}, and we only need to identify its cofibre as $\Mod_R^{S\mhyph\mathrm{tors}}$.
	
	We know that the cofibre is a left Bousfield localisation $p\colon \Mod_R\morphism \Cc$ onto some full sub-$\infty$-category $\Cc\subseteq \Mod_R$. From \cref{thm:VerdierStuff} again, we get functorial fibre sequences $p(M)\morphism M\morphism S\otimes_RM$ for all $M\in \Mod_R$. Since $I\morphism R\morphism S$ is a fibre sequence and $M\simeq R\otimes_RM$, this implies $p(M)\simeq I\otimes_RM$, as claimed. Now $\Cc$ is spanned precisely by those $M$ for which $p(M)\isomorphism M$ is an equivalence. But this is equivalent to $S\otimes_RM\simeq 0$ by the fibre sequence above, hence $\Cc\simeq \Mod_R^{S\mhyph\mathrm{tors}}$, as claimed. It remains to show that $\hom_R(I,-)$ is a right adjoint of $I\otimes_R-$, but that's clear from the tensor-$\Hom$ adjunction.
\end{proof*}\refstepcounter{smallerdummy}
\numpar*{\thesmallerdummy. Torsion Modules and Complete Modules}\cref{lem:LocalisationRecollement} already has cool consequences in the special case where $f$ is the localisation $R\morphism R[s^{-1}]$ at a single element $s\in \pi_0(R)$ (we only considered the special case $\IS\morphism \IS[p^{-1}]$ for some prime $p$ in the lecture, but everything will work in general). To this end, we consider the following two stable  sub-$\infty$-categories:
\begin{equation*}
	\Mod_R^{s\mhyph\mathrm{comp}}\subseteq \Mod_R\quad\text{and}\quad \Mod_R^{s^\infty\mhyph\mathrm{tors}}\subseteq \Mod_R
\end{equation*}
The left one is spanned by the \emph{$s$-complete} $R$-module spectra, as introduced in Lemma/Defi-nition~\labelcref{lemdef*:pComplete}. The right one is spanned by the \emph{$s$-power torsion} $R$-module spectra. These are those $M$ for which $M\simeq M\otimes_R(R/s^\infty)[-1]$, where we denote $R/s^\infty\simeq R[s^{-1}]/R$. Then $R/s^\infty\simeq \colimit_{n\in\IN} R/s^n$, and in general
\begin{equation*}
	M\otimes_R(R/s^n)[-1]\simeq \fib(s^n\colon M\morphism M)\simeq M[s^n]
\end{equation*}
is the $s^n$-torsion part of $M$. Hence $M$ is an $s$-power torsion $R$-module spectrum iff it is the colimit of its $s^n$-torsion parts, as one would expect.

Also recall that $\roof{M}_s\simeq \hom_R((R/s^\infty)[-1],M)$ denotes the $s$-completion of $M$ as defined in \cref{par:pCompletion}. Additionally, we introduce the notation
\begin{equation*}
	 \div_s(M)\coloneqq \hom_R\big(R[s^{-1}],M\big)\simeq \limit_{\IN^\op}\left(\dotso\morphism[s] M\morphism [s]M\morphism [s]M\right)
\end{equation*}
for the \emph{$s$-divisible part} of $M$. With this terminology out of the way, we obtain that \cref{thm:VerdierStuff} and \cref{lem:LocalisationRecollement} imply a version of Greenlees--May duality.
\begin{smallcor}\label{cor:GreenleesMay}
	The functors
	\begin{equation*}
		(-)_s^\complete\colon \Mod_R^{s^\infty\mhyph\mathrm{tors}}\doublelrmorphism[\sim][\sim] \Mod_R^{s\mhyph\mathrm{comp}}\noloc -\otimes_R(R/s^\infty)[-1]
	\end{equation*}
	are inverse equivalences. Furthermore, for all $R$-module spectra $M$ there are canonical pushout/pullback squares
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\vphantom{\div_s(M/s^\infty M)}M\rar\dar\drar[pullback] & \roof{M}_s\dar\\
			M[s^{-1}]\rar & \roof{M}_s[s^{-1}]
		\end{tikzcd}\quad\text{and}\quad \begin{tikzcd}
		\vphantom{\roof{M}_s}\div_s(M\otimes_RR/s^\infty)\rar\dar\drar[pullback] & \div_s(M){[1]}\dar\\
		\vphantom{\roof{M}_s[s^{-1}]}M\otimes_RR/s^\infty\rar & M{[1]}
	\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
\end{smallcor}

\begin{proof}
	We apply \cref{lem:LocalisationRecollement} in the special case $S\simeq R[s^{-1}]$. Then $I\simeq  (R/s^\infty)[-1]$ and thus $\hom_R(I,-)\simeq (-)_s^\complete$ is the $s$-completion functor. Likewise, $\hom_R(R[s^{-1}],-)\simeq \div_s(-)$ extracts the $s$-divisible part as above. Finally, we have
	\begin{equation*}
		\Mod_R^{s^\infty\mhyph\mathrm{tors}}\simeq \Mod_R^{R[s^{-1}]\mhyph\mathrm{tors}}\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Indeed, from the fibre sequence $(R/s^\infty)[-1]\morphism R\morphism R[s^{-1}]$ we get that $M\otimes_RR[s^{-1}]$ is equivalent to $M\simeq M\otimes_R(R/s^\infty)[-1]$, hence the $R[s^{-1}]$-torsion modules are precisely the $s$-power torsion modules, as claimed.
	
	By \cref{thm:VerdierStuff}, the bottom half in \cref{lem:LocalisationRecollement} is a left split Verdier sequence. Applying this in our special case $S\simeq R[s^{-1}]$ together with our considerations above, this left split Verdier sequence appears as
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large]
			\Mod_R^{s^\infty\mhyph\mathrm{tors}}\rar["{(-)_s^\complete\vphantom{\widehat{X}}}"'] & \Mod_R\rar["{\div_s(-)\vphantom{\widehat{X}}}"']\lar[dashed,bend right=45,"{-\otimes_R(R/s^\infty)[-1]}"{swap,above}] & \Mod_{R[s^{-1}]}\lar[dashed,bend right=45,"f^*"']
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	In particular, the $s$-completion functor $(-)_s^\complete$ is fully faithful with essential image the fibre of $\div_s(-)\colon \Mod_R\morphism \Mod_{R[s^{-1}]}$. By Lemma/Definition~\labelcref{lemdef*:pComplete}, this means that $(-)_s^\complete$ is an equivalence onto $\Mod_R^{s\mhyph\mathrm{comp}}$. Hence its left adjoint $-\otimes_R(R/s^\infty)[-1]$ is an inverse equivalence. This proves the first half of the corollary, and the second half follows straight from \cref{thm:VerdierStuff}.
\end{proof}
Note that the left pullback square from \cref{cor:GreenleesMay} already made its appearance in \cref{lem:Nakayama}\itememph{b}. But now we've seen that it also follows from ridiculously general principles. Cool, right? Similarly, applying \cref{lem:LocalisationRecollement} to the localisation $\IS\morphism H\IQ$ gives the arithmetic fracture square from \cref{lem:ArithmeticFractureSquare}\itememph{c}!


Now onwards to the proof of \cref{thm:K=coreGrp}. We start with a somewhat random lemma/definition.
\begin{lemdef}\label{lem:SpanF}
	Let $\Cc$ be a stable $\infty$-category. For each $0\leq i\leq n$ the pushout square
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
 			{[0]}\rar["0"]\dar["i"']\drar[pushout] & {[n-i]}\dar["+i"]\\
			{[i]}\rar & {[n]}
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	in $\IDelta$ gives a Verdier square
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
		Q_n(\Cc)\rar\dar\drar[pullback] & Q_i(\Cc)\dar\\
		Q_{n-i}(\Cc)\rar & Q_0(\Cc)
		\end{tikzcd}	\end{equation*}
	In particular, for an additive functor $F\colon \Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st}\morphism \An$, the simplicial anima $F( Q(\Cc))\in \cat{sAn}$ is a \embrace{not necessarily complete} Segal anima and we put
	\begin{equation*}
		\Span^F(\Cc)\coloneqq \asscat\big(F( Q(\Cc))\big)\,.
	\end{equation*}
\end{lemdef}
\begin{proof}
	Let's first check that our would-be split Verdier square is a pullback square at all (in $\Cat_\infty$ or $\Catst$, that doesn't matter by \cref{par:MoreOnVerdierSequences}\itememph{e}). This follows from direct inspection, as the Quillen $Q$-construction satisfies the Segal condition by \cref{propdef:SpanQ}, so $Q_n(\Cc)$ can be written as the $(n+1)$-fold pullback $Q_1(\Cc)\times_{Q_0(\Cc)}\dotsb\times_{Q_0(\Cc)}Q_1(\Cc)$. A similar argument shows that once we know that the pullback square is split Verdier, $F( Q(\Cc))$ will indeed satisfy the Segal condition, since $F$ sends split Verdier squares to pullbacks.
	
	So it remains to show that the pullback square is split Verdier. Recall from the proof of \cref{propdef:SpanQ} that $Q_n(\Cc)\simeq \Fun(J_n,\Cc)$, where $J_n$ is a zigzag

	\end{center}
	In general, if $\iota\colon [k]\monomorphism{} [\ell]$ is the inclusion of an interval, then it induces a fully faithful functor $\iota\colon J_k\morphism J_\ell$. Since the $J_i$ are finite and $\Cc$ has finite limits and colimits, $\iota^*\colon \Fun(J_\ell,\Cc)\morphism \Fun(J_k,\Cc)$ has both adjoints, given by left and right Kan extension, and they are fully faithful again by \cref{cor:FullyFaithfulKanExtension}, Thus $Q_\ell(\Cc)\morphism Q_k(\Cc)$ is a split Verdier projection by \cref{thm:VerdierStuff}\itememph{b}. This clearly applies in our case, whence we're done.
\end{proof}
\begin{thm}[Waldhausen's additivity theorem]\label{thm:Additivity}
	If $F\colon \Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st}\morphism\An$ is additive, then so is
	\begin{equation*}
		\big|\Span^F(-)\big|\colon \Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st}\morphism \An\,.
	\end{equation*}
	In particular, $k\colon \Cat_\infty^\mathrm{st}\morphism \An$ is additive.
\end{thm}
This particular general formulation of the additivity theorem, or to be really precise, its further generalisation to Poincaré categories, first appeared in \cite[Theorem~2.4.1]{9author2}. But of course the original formulation (with $F\simeq \core$) is due to Waldhausen.
\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{thm:Additivity}]
	The \enquote{in particular} follows as $k(\Cc)\simeq \Omega\left|\Span(\Cc)\right|\simeq \Omega\left|\Span^{\core}(\Cc)\right|$ by \cref{prop:QvsS}, $\core$ is additive by \cref{par:MoreOnTwAr}\itememph{d}, and $\Omega$ preserves pullbacks. The proof of the main statement consists of four steps.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item[\itememph{1}] \itshape We prove that if $p\colon \Cc\morphism\Dd$ is a split Verdier projection, then it is  a bicartesian fibration \embrace{i.e.\ both cartesian and cocartesian}.
	\end{alphanumerate}

	This step is basically a consequence of the following simple lemma.
	\begin{lem}\label{lem:CocartesianLemma}
		Let $g\colon \Bb\shortdoublelrmorphism\Aa\noloc f$ be an adjoint pair in $\Cat_\infty$, with counit $c\colon gf\Rightarrow\id_\Aa$.
		\begin{alphanumerate}
			\item A morphism $\phi\colon x\morphism y$ in $\Aa$ is $f$-cocartesian iff the square
			\begin{equation*}
				\begin{tikzcd}
					gf(x)\rar["gf(\phi)"]\dar["c"']\drar[pushout] & gf(y)\dar["c"]\\
					x\rar["\phi"] & y
				\end{tikzcd}
			\end{equation*}
			is a pushout in $\Aa$.
			\item If $\Aa$ admits pushouts, $f$ preserves pushouts, and $g$ is fully faithful, then $f$ is a cocartesian fibration.
		\end{alphanumerate}
	\end{lem}
	\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{lem:CocartesianLemma}]
		For \itememph{a}, plug the $(g,f)$-adjunction into the pullback square from \cref{def:WeirdCocartesianDefinition}\itememph{a}. For \itememph{b}, let $\phi'\colon x'\morphism y'$ be a morphism in $\Bb$ and let $x\in \Aa$ with $f(x)\simeq x'$ be given. Since $g$ is fully faithful, we have $y'\simeq fg(y')$, hence the morphism $\phi'\colon f(x)\morphism y'$ induces a morphism $gf(x)\morphism g(y')$ by adjunction. Now form the pushout
		\begin{equation*}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				gf(x)\rar \dar["c"']\drar[pushout] & g(y')\dar\\
				x\rar["\phi"] & y
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{equation*}
		in $\Aa$. Note that $f(c)\colon fgf(x)\morphism f(x)\simeq x'$ is equivalent to the identity on $x'$ since $g$ is fully faithful. Moreover, $f$ preserve pushouts. Therefore, applying $f$ to the pushout square above gives a pushout
		\begin{equation*}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				x'\eqar[d] \rar["\phi'"]\drar[pushout] & y'\dar\\
				x\rar["f(\phi)"] & y
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{equation*}
		Hence $f(\phi)\simeq \phi'$, so $\phi\colon x\morphism y$ is a lift of $\phi'$. By \itememph{a}, it is even an $f$-cocartesian lift, proving that $f$ is indeed a cocartesian fibration.
	\end{proof}
	Now we resume the proof of \cref{thm:Additivity}. Applying \cref{lem:CocartesianLemma}\itememph{b} to $p$ and its fully faithful left adjoint (which are exact functors between stable $\infty$-categories, so all assumptions are verified) shows that $p$ is a cocartesian fibration. By a dual argument applied to $p$ and its fully faithful right adjoint, $p$ is also cartesian. This finishes Step~\itememph{1}.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item[\itememph{2}] \itshape We prove that if $p\colon \Cc\morphism\Dd$ is a split Verdier projection \embrace{thus an exact bicartesian fibration by Step~\itememph{1}}, then 
		\begin{equation*}
			\Span^F(p)\colon \Span^F(\Cc)\morphism\Span^F(\Dd)
		\end{equation*}
		is a  bicartesian fibration as well.
	\end{alphanumerate}

	\lecture[End of the proof of the additivity theorem. Group completion for additive functors. Rezk's equifibrancy lemma.]{2021-02-09}Let's first discuss the case $F\simeq \core$, which is of course the one of most interest to us, since it leads to $K$-theory, but it will also be half of the argument for the general case. We claim:
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item[\itememph{\boxtimes}]\itshape A morphism $x\morphism z$ in $\Span(\Cc)$, i.e., a span $x\lmorphism y\morphism z$ in $\Cc$, is $\Span(p)$-cocartesian if $y\morphism x$ is $p$-cartesian and $y\morphism z$ is $p$-cocartesian.
	\end{alphanumerate}
	Unravelling what a map $\Lambda_0^2\morphism \Span(\Cc)$ and a map $\Delta^2\morphism\Span(\Dd)$ look like, we have to show the following: Suppose we're given two solid diagrams
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzpicture}[x=1cm,y=1cm,line cap=round,baseline=(10.base)]
			\node (00) at (0,0) {$x$};
			\node (01) at (2,0) {$z$};
			\node (02) at (4,0) {$v$};
			\node (10) at (1,1) {$y$};
			\node (11) at (3,1) {$\bullet$};
			\node (20) at (2,2) {$w$};

			\node[dotted,rotate=-45] at (2,1) {$\scriptstyle\pullbacksign$};
			\draw[-to,bend right] (20) to (00);
			\draw[-to,bend left] (20) to (02);
		\end{tikzpicture}\quad\overset{p}{\longmapsto}\quad
		\begin{tikzpicture}[x=1cm,y=1cm,line cap=round,baseline=(10.base)]
			\node (00) at (0,0) {$p(x)$};
			\node (01) at (2,0) {$p(z)$};
			\node (02) at (4,0) {$p(v)$};

			\draw[-to] (11) to (02);
			\node[rotate=-45] at (2,1) {$\scriptstyle\pullbacksign$};
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{equation*}
	in $\Cc$ and $\Dd$, respectively, such that the left one is mapped into the right one under $p$. We must show that we can fill in all the dotted arrows (along with the missing object $\bullet$) in the left diagram in such a way that the square in the middle becomes a pullback. We can fill in the dotted arrow labelled \enquote{$(1)$} since $y\morphism x$ is $p$-cartesian. Next, we can choose the dotted arrow \enquote{$(2)$} to be a $p$-cocartesian lift of $p(w)\morphism u$. Since $w\morphism \bullet$ is now $p$-cocartesian, we can fill in the two missing dotted arrows \enquote{$(3)$} and \enquote{$(4)$}. Playing around with \cref{def:WeirdCocartesianDefinition}\itememph{a} easily shows that the square in the middle is a pushout iff $w\morphism \bullet$ is $p$-cocartesian. Hence it is a pushout by construction, and thus also a pullback since $\Cc$ is a stable $\infty$-category. This proves \itememph{\boxtimes}. Let us also remark that our argument shows that filling in the dotted arrows is unique up to contractible choice. Indeed, this is clear for \enquote{$(1)$}, \enquote{$(3)$}, and \enquote{$(4)$}, and for \enquote{$(2)$} we've just argued that we need to choose $w\morphism \bullet$ as a $p$-cocartesian lift of $p(w)\morphism u$ to make the middle square a pullback.
	
	We can now conclude that $\Span(p)\colon \Span(\Cc)\morphism \Span(\Dd)$ is a bicartesian fibration. Indeed, $p$ is bicartesian by Step~\itememph{1}, and given any span $p(x)\lmorphism y'\morphism z'$ in $\Dd$, we can lift the left map to a $p$-cartesian edge $y\morphism x$, and then the right map to a $p$-cocartesian edge $y\morphism z$, which proves that $\Span(p)$ is a cocartesian fibration by \itememph{\boxtimes}. Dualising the argument shows that $\Span(p)$ is also cartesian.
	
	
	Now for the general case. Let $\Ee\subseteq Q_1(\Cc)\simeq \Fun(J_1,\Cc)$ be the full sub-$\infty$-category where the left edge is $p$-cartesian and the right edge is $p$-cocartesian. Then the diagram
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\Ee\dar["p"']\rar["d_1"]\drar[pullback] & \Cc\dar["p"]\\
			Q_1(\Dd)\rar["d_1"] & \Dd
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	is a pullback. Informally, this is because we can lift any span $(p(x)\lmorphism y'\morphism z')\in Q_1(\Dd)$ to a span $(x\lmorphism y\morphism z)\in \Ee$ as argued in the previous paragraph, and this lift is necessarily unique up to contractible choice since so is taking $p$-cartesian and $p$-cocartesian lifts. For a more formal argument, you would have to show that the map from $\Ee$ to the pullback is fully faithful and essentially surjective. Essential surjectivity follows from the argument we've just given. For fully faithfulness, use \cref{cor:HomInFunctorCats} to compute $\Hom$ anima in $Q_1(\Cc)$ and $Q_1(\Dd)$ (we have $\TwAr(J_1)\simeq J_2^\op$, so the formula really is not too bad) and then simplify using the pullback square from \cref{def:WeirdCocartesianDefinition}\itememph{a} and its dual for cartesian edges. I'll leave working out the details to you.
	
	Likewise, we get a pullback diagram
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\Ee\times_{Q_1(\Cc)}Q_2(\Cc)\dar["p"']\rar["{(\id_\Ee,d_1)}"]\drar[pullback] & \Ee\times_\Cc Q_1(\Cc)\dar["p"]\\
			Q_2(\Dd)\rar["{(d_2,d_1)}"] & Q_1(\Dd)\times_\Dd Q_1(\Dd)
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	where the fibre product in the upper left corner is formed using $d_2\colon Q_2(\Cc)\morphism Q_1(\Cc)$. Informally, this square being a pullback is precisely what we proved in \itememph{\boxtimes}. Indeed, $\Ee\times_\Cc Q_1(\Cc)$ encodes the data of the diagram without the dotted arrows filled in, $Q_2(\Dd)$ encodes the data of the solid diagram in $\Dd$, and $Q_1(\Dd)\times_\Dd Q_1(\Dd)$ makes sure these two are compatible under $p$. We've seen in \itememph{\boxtimes} that it's always possible to fill in the dotted arrows, so that we obtain an object of $\Ee\times_{Q_1(\Cc)}Q_2(\Cc)$. Moreover, this object is unique up to contractible choice, as we've noted at the end of the proof of \itememph{\boxtimes}. This is the informal reason why $\Ee\times_{Q_1(\Cc)}Q_2(\Cc)$ is the pullback. To make this argument formal, you would again have to show that the map from $\Ee\times_{Q_1(\Cc)}Q_2(\Cc)$ to the pullback is fully faithful and essentially surjective. Essential surjectivity follows from the informal argument, and for fully faithfulness you have to compute $\Hom$ anima again using \cref{cor:HomInFunctorCats} (and even $\Hom$ anima in $Q_2(\Cc)$ are not too bad since limits over $\TwAr(J_2)\simeq J_3^\op$ are very manageable).
	
	Long story short, we get two pullback squares. But in fact they are split Verdier squares! Indeed, by \labelcref{par:EvenMoreOnVerdierSequences}, we only need to check that $\Cc\morphism \Dd$ and $\Ee\times_\Cc Q_1(\Cc)\morphism Q_1(\Dd)\times_\Dd Q_1(\Dd)$ are split Verdier projection. For the first one, this holds by assumption. The second one is a pullback of $Q_1(\Cc)\morphism Q_1(\Dd)$ (using the first pullback square), which is a split Verdier projection because the fully faithful left and right adjoints of $\Cc\morphism \Dd$ extend to functor $\infty$-categories.
	
	Thus, both diagrams stay pullback squares after applying the additive functor $F$. The second diagram then witnesses that the image of
	\begin{equation*}
		F(\Ee)\morphism F\big(Q_1(\Cc)\big)\morphism \Hom_{\Cat_\infty}\big([1],\Span^F(\Cc)\big)
	\end{equation*}
	consists of $\Span^F(p)$-cocartesian edges (essentially by running the above arguments backwards), and the first diagram gives a sufficient supply of these. This shows that $\Span^F(p)$ is indeed a cocartesian fibration. By a dual argument we see that it is cartesian as well. This finishes Step~\itememph{2}.
	
	
	
	
	
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item[\itememph{3}] \itshape We prove that the functor $|\blank|\colon \Cat_\infty\morphism\An$ preserves pullback squares if one of the legs is a bicartesian fibration.
	\end{alphanumerate}

	This step is easy again. Suppose we're given a pullback
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\Aa\dar\rar\drar[pullback] &\Bb\dar\\
			\Cc\rar["p"] & \Dd
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	in $\Cat_\infty$, such that  $\Bb\morphism \Dd$ and thus also $\Aa\morphism \Cc$ are bicartesian fibrations. We denote by $F\coloneqq \St^\cocart(\Bb\morphism\Dd)\colon \Dd\morphism \Cat_\infty$ be the cocartesian straightening of $\Bb\morphism\Dd$. Since unstraightening turns compositions into pullbacks, we obtain
	\begin{equation*}
	%	\begin{tikzcd}
	%		\Un^\cocart(F\circ p)\dar\rar\drar[pullback] &\Un^\cocart(F)\dar\\
	%		\Cc\rar["p"] & \Dd
	%	\end{tikzcd}
		\Un^\cocart(F\circ p)\simeq \Aa\quad\text{and}\quad \Un^\cocart(F)\simeq \Bb\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Now consider the diagram
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\Dd\rar["F"]\dar &\Cat_\infty\rar["{|\blank|}"] & \An\\
			{|\Dd|}\ar[urr,bend right=15,dashed,"{|F|}"']
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	Note that since $F$ is a bicartesian fibration, every morphism $\phi\colon x\morphism y$ in $\Dd$ is sent to a left-adjoint functor $F(\phi)\colon F(x)\morphism F(y)$, hence to an equivalence $|F(\phi)|\colon |F(x)|\isomorphism |F(y)|$. Hence the dashed arrow exists by the universal property of localisations of $\infty$-categories.
	
	By unstraightening of functors into $\An$, we now get a pullback diagram
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\Un^\mathrm{left}\big(|F|\circ |p|\big)\dar\rar\drar[pullback] &\Un^\mathrm{left}\big(|F|\big)\dar\\
			{|\Cc|}\rar["{|p|}"] & {|\Dd|}
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	So we're done if we can show that $\Un^\mathrm{left}(|F|)$ and $\Un^\mathrm{left}(|F|\circ |p|)$ are the realisations of $\Un^\cocart(F)$ and $\Un^\cocart(F\circ p)$, respectively. The easiest way to see this is probably \cref{prop:CoLimitsInCat}: We know that $\colimit(F\colon \Dd\morphism \Cat_\infty)$ is some localisation of $\Un^\cocart(F)$, hence
	\begin{align*}
		\left|\Un^\cocart(F)\right|\simeq \Big|\colimit\Big(\Dd\morphism[F] \Cat_\infty\Big)\Big|&\simeq \colimit\Big(\Dd\morphism[F] \Cat_\infty\morphism[|\blank|]\An\Big)\\
		&\simeq \colimit\Big(|\Dd|\morphism[|F|] \An\Big)\\
		&\simeq \Un^\mathrm{left}\big(|F|\big)\,,
	\end{align*}
	as desired. The second equivalence follows from the fact that $|\blank|\colon \Cat_\infty\morphism \An$, being a left adjoint, preserves colimits. For the third equivalence, we use that the localisation $\Dd\morphism|\Dd|$ is cofinal, as we noted after \cref{def:cofinal}. For $\Un^\cocart(F\circ p)$ we can use a similar argument. This finishes Step~\itememph{3}.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item[\itememph{4}] \itshape We prove that $\Span^F(-)$ sends split Verdier squares to pullbacks in $\Cat_\infty$ and finish the proof of \cref{thm:Additivity}.
	\end{alphanumerate}

	If we can show the first assertion, then a combination of Step~\itememph{2} and~\itememph{3} seals the deal. Recall that $\Span^F\simeq \asscat(F(Q(-)))$ by \cref{lem:SpanF}. So let
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\Aa\dar\rar\drar[pullback] &\Bb\dar\\
			\Cc\rar & \Dd
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	be a split Verdier square. We know that $Q_n(-)\colon \Catst\morphism\Catst$ preserves split Verdier squares for all $n\in\IN$ (because $Q_n(-)\simeq \Fun(J_n,-)$ preserves pullbacks and the required fully faithful adjoints extend to functor $\infty$-categories) and $F$ turns them into pullbacks in $\An$, hence
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			F \big(Q(\Aa)\big)\dar\rar\drar[pullback] &F\big(Q(\Bb)\big)\dar\\
			F\big(Q(\Cc)\big)\rar & F\big(Q(\Dd)\big)
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	is a pullback in $\cat{sAn}$. In fact, it is even a Segal anima by \cref{lem:SpanF}. However, $\asscat(-)\colon \cat{sAn}\morphism \Cat_\infty$ doesn't necessarily preserve pullbacks of incomplete Segal anima. However, the canonical (up to contractible choice) morphism
	\begin{equation*}
		\asscat(X\times_YZ)\morphism \asscat(X)\times_{\asscat(Y)}\asscat(Z)
	\end{equation*}
	is always fully faithful for Segal anima $X,Y,Z\in\cat{sAn}$, as follows from \cref{eq:asscat2}. So only essential surjectivity can go wrong. Recall that $\core \asscat(X)\simeq |X^\times|$ for $X$ Segal by \cref{eq:asscat1}. We claim that
	\begin{equation*}
		\pi_0\left|X^\times\times_{Y^\times}Z^\times\right|\morphism \pi_0\left(|X^\times|\times_{|Y^\times|}|Z^\times|\right)
	\end{equation*}
	is surjective if $\asscat(X)\morphism\asscat(Y)$ is a bicartesian fibration, which will be sufficient for our case by Step~\itememph{2}. Every connected component on the right-hand side can be represented by points $x\in X_0$, $z\in Z_0$, and a path in $|Y^\times|$ connecting their images. To see why the $0$-skeleta already hit all path components, take a look again at the skeletal method in the proof of \cref{lem:SkeletalInduction}, and in particular, at \cref{eq:SkeletalInduction}. Again by considering skeleta, we see that two points belonging to the same path component in $|Y^\times|$ is already determined by $Y_1^\times$. Hence there are edges $y_i\in Y_1^\times$ and a path $w$ in $Y_0$ that connect $x$ and $z$ via
	\begin{equation*}
		x\morphism[y_1]s_1\lmorphism[y_2]s_2\morphism[y_3]\dotso \xleftarrow{y_{2n}}s_{2n}\overset{w}{\longrightsquigarrow{\morphismlength-0.145em}} z
	\end{equation*}
	Using that $\asscat(X)\morphism\asscat(Y)$ is a bicartesian fibration, we can lift this to a similar sequence in $X$, which gives a connected component in $\pi_0|X^\times\times_{Y^\times}Z^\times|$. This shows the desired surjectivity and the proof is finally done!
\end{proof}

We're now almost in position to prove \cref{thm:K=coreGrp}. But Fabian decided to give a brief discussion of grouplike additive functors and their span $\infty$-categories first. To make the result of that discussion more comprehensible, I put them into a separate lemma.
\begin{lem}\label{lem:GrouplikeFunctors}
	Suppose $F\colon \Catst\morphism \An$ is a grouplike additive functor and let $\Cc$ be a stable $\infty$-category. Then
	\begin{equation*}
		F\big(\Ar(\Cc)\big)\simeq F(\Cc)\times F(\Cc)\quad\text{and}\quad F\big(Q_n(\Cc)\big)\simeq F(\Cc)^{2n+1}
	\end{equation*}
	for all $n\in\IN$. More generally, there's an equivalence
	\begin{equation*}
		\operatorname{Bar}\big(*,F(\Cc)\times F(\Cc),F(\Cc)\big)\isomorphism F\big( Q(\Cc)\big)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Finally, $\Span^F(\Cc)\simeq B F(\Cc)$ \embrace{so in particular $\Span^F(\Cc)$ is a connected anima}.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
	The equivalence $F(\Ar(\Cc))\simeq F(\Cc)\times F(\Cc)$ follows from the stable recollement from \cref{par:Recollements} together with \cref{par:MoreOnVerdierSequences}\itememph{d^*}. The equivalence $F(Q_n(\Cc))\isomorphism F(\Cc)^{2n+1}$ is induced by evaluation $Q_n(\Cc)\simeq \Fun(J_n,\Cc)\morphism \Cc$ at the $2n+1$ objects of $J_n$. To see that it is indeed an equivalence, let's first consider the case $n=1$. In this case we have a split Verdier sequence $\Cc\morphism Q_1(\Cc)\morphism \Ar(\Cc)$ (adjoints are given by left/right Kan extension along $[1]\morphism J_1$), which proves $F(Q_1(\Cc))\simeq F(\Cc)^3$ by \cref{par:MoreOnVerdierSequences}\itememph{d^*}. The general case follows either by induction, or by the an iterative application of the split Verdier square from \cref{lem:SpanF}.
	
	We've seen in \cref{par:MoreOnVerdierSequences}\itememph{c} that $F(\Cc)$ has a canonical $\IE_\infty$-group structure. Moreover, its addition map $\oplus\colon F(\Cc)\times F(\Cc)\morphism F(\Cc)$ turns $F(\Cc)$ into a left module over $F(\Cc)\times F(\Cc)$.  We may thus form $\operatorname{Bar}(*,F(\Cc)\times F(\Cc),F(\Cc))\colon \IDelta^\op\morphism \CGrp(\An)$ as in \labelcref{par:BarConstruction}. By construction, it satisfies
	\begin{equation*}
		\operatorname{Bar}_n\big(*,F(\Cc)\times F(\Cc),F(\Cc)\big)\simeq F(\Cc)^{2n+1}\,,
	\end{equation*}
	so it coincides degreewise with $F( Q(\Cc))$. But $\operatorname{Bar}(*,F(\Cc)\times F(\Cc),F(\Cc))$ is also left-Kan extended from its restriction along $\IDelta_{\mathrm{inj},\leq 1}^\op\morphism \IDelta^\op$, so it's easy to construct a functor from it into $F( Q(\Cc))$, which is then a degreewise equivalence.
	
	From the description as a bar complex, or just by checking directly, one can verify that $F(Q_1(\Cc))^\times\simeq F(Q_1(\Cc))$. Hence $\Span^F(\Cc)\simeq \asscat(F (Q(\Cc)))$ is an anima (combine \cref{thmdef:RezkNerve}\itememph{c} with \cref{eq:asscat2} to see that all edges are equivalences). Moreover, it is connected. To see this, we first note $\Span^F(\Cc)\simeq \core (\asscat(F (Q(\Cc))))\simeq |F(Q(\Cc))^\times|$ by \cref{eq:asscat1}. Now $\pi_0$ of the right-hand side can be computed as described in claim~\itememph{*} in the proof of \cref{prop:CompletionOfMonoidsFullyFaithful}, the result being
	\begin{align*}
		\pi_0\big|F\big(Q(\Cc)\big)^\times\big|&= \Coeq\left(\pi_0F\big(Q_1(\Cc)\big)^\times\doublemorphism[d_1][d_0] \pi_0F\big(Q_0(\Cc)\big)^\times\right)\\
		&=\Coeq\left(\pi_0F\big(Q_1(\Cc)\big)\doublemorphism[d_1][d_0] \pi_0F\big(Q_0(\Cc)\big)\right)\\
		&=\Coeq\left(\pi_0F(\Cc)^3\doublemorphism[\pr_1][\pr_3] \pi_0F(\Cc)\right)\,,
	\end{align*}
	which evidently vanishes. Hence to prove $\Span^F(\Cc)\simeq BF(\Cc)$, it suffices to compute that $\Omega_0\Span^F(\Cc)\simeq F(\Cc)$ by \cref{par:Grp(An)=(*/An)Connected}. Now $\Omega_0\Span^F(\Cc)$ coincides with $\Hom_{\Span^F(\Cc)}(0,0)$. To compute this, consider\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\Cc\dar\rar\drar[pullback] & Q_1(\Cc)\dar["{(d_1,d_0)}"]\\
			0\rar & Q_0(\Cc)\times Q_0(\Cc)
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	It is a pullback by inspection, as there are $\Cc$ possibilities to fill in the missing spot in a span $0\lmorphism \bullet\morphism 0$.
	It is even a split Verdier square, since the right vertical arrow has both adjoints, given by left and right Kan extension, which are both fully faithful (in fact, both adjoints agree and send a pair $(x,y)\in Q_0(\Cc)\times Q_0(\Cc)\simeq \Cc\times \Cc$ to the span $x\lmorphism x\oplus y\morphism y$ in $Q_1(\Cc)\simeq \Fun(J_1,\Cc)$). So the pullback property is preserved upon applying $F$. But after applying $F$, the new pullback diagram computes $\Hom_{\Span^F(\Cc)}(0,0)$ by \cref{eq:asscat2}.
\end{proof}
Fabian remarks that the special case $k(\Ar(\Cc))\simeq k(\Cc)\times k(\Cc)$ of \cref{lem:GrouplikeFunctors} is the content of Waldhausen's original additivity theorem. Moreover, we've seen in the proof that $F(Q_1(\Cc))^\times\simeq F(Q_1(\Cc))$ for every grouplike additive functor $F$. This tells us that the Segal anima $F (Q(\Cc))$ is seldom complete: By \cref{thmdef:RezkNerve}\itememph{c}, we would need that
\begin{equation*}
	F(\Cc)\simeq F\big(Q_0(\Cc)\big)\isomorphism F\big(Q_1(\Cc)\big)^\times\simeq F(\Cc)^3
\end{equation*}
is an equivalence, which only holds if $F(\Cc)\simeq 0$.
\begin{thm}\label{thm:SpanF}
	If $F\colon \Catst\morphism\An$ is grouplike and additive and $\Cc$ is a stable $\infty$-category $\Cc$, then applying the realisation functor $|\blank|\colon \Cat_\infty\morphism \An$ to the pullback square
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\Hom_{\Span^F(\Cc)}(0,0)\rar\dar\drar[pullback] & 0/\Span^F(\Cc)\dar\\
			*\rar["0"] & \Span^F(\Cc)
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	in $\Cat_\infty$ gives a pullback square
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			F(\Cc)\rar\dar\drar[pullback] & *\dar["0"]\\
			*\rar["0"] & {|\Span^F(\Cc)|}
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	in $\An$. So in particular, $F(\Cc)\simeq \Omega |\Span^F(\Cc)|$.
\end{thm}
With that, we can finally prove the theorem of Blumberg--Gepner--Tabuada.
\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{thm:K=coreGrp}]\label{page:ProofOfBlumbergGepnerTabuada}
	First note that $\Omega|\Span^F(-)|$ is additive again for any additive functor $F$, since it is the composition of the additive functor $|\Span^F(-)|$ (\cref{thm:Additivity}) with the limits-preserving functor $\Omega\colon \CMon(\An)\morphism \CGrp(\An)$ (\cref{cor:CommutativeHorizontalAdjoints}\itememph{b}). This also shows that $\Omega|\Span^F(-)|$ takes values in the grouplikes.
	
	As always, we'll use Proposition~\labelcref{prop:LLaddendum} to prove that 
	\begin{equation*}
		L\simeq \Omega |\Span^{(-)}(-)|\colon \Fun^\add(\Catst,\An)\morphism \Fun^\grp(\Catst,\An)
	\end{equation*}
	is a left Bousfield localisation. First, we need a natural transformation $\eta\colon \id \Rightarrow L$. The computation in the proof of \cref{lem:GrouplikeFunctors} shows $F(\Cc)\simeq \Hom_{\Span^F(\Cc)}(0,0)$ for all additive functors $F$ (although we assumed that $F$ is grouplike there, but this isn't needed in the computation). Composing with the natural map 
	\begin{equation*}
		\Hom_{\Span^F(\Cc)}(0,0)\morphism \Hom_{|\Span^F(\Cc)|}(0,0)\simeq \Omega|\Span^F(\Cc)|
	\end{equation*}
	gives a map $F(\Cc)\morphism \Omega|\Span^F(\Cc)|$ which is functorial in $\Cc$ and $F$, thus providing the required transformation $\eta\colon \id\Rightarrow L$. Now \cref{thm:SpanF} implies that $\eta L,L\eta\colon L\overset{\sim}{\Longrightarrow} L\circ L$ are both equivalences, whence $L$ is indeed a left Bousfield localisation. Its essential image is contained in the grouplike functors as checked above, hence equals the grouplike functors since \cref{thm:SpanF} precisely says that $\eta$ is an equivalence on grouplikes.
\end{proof}
For the proof of \cref{thm:SpanF} we'll employ Rezk's equifibrancy lemma.
\begin{lemdef}[Rezk]\label{lemdef:Equifibred}
	Let $\Ii$ be any $\infty$-category \embrace{which we think of as a digram shape}. Suppose we're given a pullback square
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			A\rar\dar["\sigma"']\drar[pullback] & B\dar["\tau"]\\
			C\rar & D
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	in $\Fun(\Ii,\An)$ such that $\tau$ us \emph{equifibred}, i.e.\ such that
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			B_i\rar\dar \drar[pullback] & B_j\dar \\
			D_i\rar & D_j
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	is a pullback for all morphisms $i\morphism j$ in $\Ii$. Then also the diagram
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=scriptsize]
			\colimit\limits_{i\in\Ii} A\rar\dar[shorten <=-0.75ex,"\sigma"']\drar[pullback] & \colimit\limits_{i\in\Ii} B_i\dar[shorten <=-0.75ex,"\tau"]\\
			\colimit\limits_{i\in\Ii} C_i\rar & \colimit\limits_{i\in\Ii} D_i
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	is a pullback in $\An$.
\end{lemdef}
\begin{proof}
	We first prove the following claim to get a description of $\colimit_\Ii B$.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item[\itememph{\boxtimes}] \itshape Suppose $\tau$ is equifibred and let $K$ be any anima. Then a transformation $\eta\colon B\Rightarrow \const K$ together with a map $K\morphism \colimit_{i\in\Ii} D_i$ make the diagram
		\begin{equation*}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				B_i\rar\dar \drar[pullback] & K\dar \\
				D_i\rar & \colimit\limits_{i\in\Ii} D_i
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{equation*}
		a pullback for each $i\in \Ii$ iff $\eta$ induces an equivalence $\colimit_{i\in\Ii} B_i\isomorphism K$.
	\end{alphanumerate}
	To prove \itememph{\boxtimes}, consider the functors $F_i\simeq \St^\mathrm{left}(B_i\morphism D_i)\colon D_i\morphism \An$. We claim that by equifibrancy of $\tau$, the $F_i$ assemble into a functor
	\begin{equation*}
		F\colon \colimit_{i\in\Ii} D_i\morphism \An\,.
	\end{equation*}
	On Sil's insistence, Fabian has given a proper argument for this in the official notes \cite[Chapter~IV p.\:46]{KTheory}, which I'll include here. The transformation $\tau$ corresponds to a map $[1]\morphism \Fun(\Ii,\An)$, which we may curry to a map $\Ii\morphism \Ar(\An)$. That $\tau$ is equifibrant means that this map sends all morphisms in $\Ii$ to morphisms in $\Ar(\An)$ which are represented by pullback squares in $\An$. On the other hand,
	\begin{equation*}
		\Fun\left(\colimit_{i\in\Ii}D_i,\An\right)\simeq \limit_{i\in \Ii^\op}\Fun(D_i,\An)\simeq \limit_{i\in\Ii^\op}\An/D_i
	\end{equation*}
	by straightening. Note that the functor $\An/-\colon \An^\op\morphism \Cat_\infty$ is not the usual slice category functor (whose codomain would be $\An$ rather than $\An^\op$). Indeed, to a map $i\morphism j$ in $\Ii$ we don't associate the forgetful functor $\An/D_i\morphism \An/D_j$, but the pullback functor $-\times_{D_j}D_i\colon\An/D_j\morphism \An/D_i$. Thus, $\An/-\colon\An^\op\morphism\Cat_\infty$ is represented by the cartesian (!) straightening of $t\colon \Ar(\An)\morphism \An$, which is in fact a cartesian fibration by \cref{exc:tCartesian}. Moreover, the $t$-cartesian edges are precisely the pullback squares, hence $\Ii\morphism \Ar(\An)$ sends every edge to a $t$-cartesian edge. Therefore, the induced map $\Ii\morphism \Ii\times_{\An}\Ar(\An)$ is a map of cartesian fibrations over $\Ii$, and thus it induces a natural transformation
	\begin{equation*}
		\left(\const *\Longrightarrow \An/D_{(-)}\right)\colon \Ii^\op\morphism \An\,.
	\end{equation*}
	This transformation induces a single map $*\morphism \limit_{i\in\Ii^\op}\An/D_i$, which provides the functor $F\colon \colimit_{i\in\Ii}\morphism \An$ we're looking for.
	
	Note that $\Un^\mathrm{left}(F)\morphism \colimit_{i\in \Ii}D_i$ is a left fibration over the anima $\colimit_{i\in \Ii}D_i$, hence $\Un^\mathrm{left}(F)$ is an anima itself. Thus $\Un^\mathrm{left}(F)\simeq |\Un^\mathrm{left}(F)|$, and we may apply  \cref{prop:CoLimitsInCat} twice to get
	\begin{align*}
		\Un^\mathrm{left}(F)\simeq \colimit_{\colimit_{i\in \Ii}D_i}F&\simeq \colimit_{i\in \Ii}\colimit_{D_i}D_i\\
		&\simeq \colimit_{i\in\Ii}\Un^\mathrm{left}(F_i)\\
		&\simeq \colimit_{i\in\Ii}B_i\,.
	\end{align*}
	This shows that $K\simeq\colimit_{i\in\Ii}B_i\simeq \Un^\mathrm{left}(F)$ does indeed fit into the pullback diagram from \itememph{\boxtimes}. Conversely, every $K\morphism \colimit_{i\in \Ii}D_i$ is uniquely determined by its pullbacks to the $D_i$, since  straightening implies $\An/\colimit_{i\in \Ii}D_i\simeq \Fun(\colimit_{i\in \Ii}D_i,\An)\simeq \limit_{i\in\Ii^\op}\An/D_i$, as seen above. So there is only one $K$ that fits into the pullbacks from \itememph{\boxtimes}, whence $K\simeq \colimit_{i\in \Ii}B_i$ is the only possibility. This shows \itememph{\boxtimes}.
	
	Now the actual proof may start. We first check that $\sigma$ is equifibred as well. To this end, let $i\morphism j$ be any morphism in $\Ii$ and consider the diagram
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=scriptsize]
			A_i\dar\rar\drar[dotted,pullback] & A_j\rar\dar\drar[pullback] &B_j\rar\dar\drar[pullback] & \colimit\limits_{i\in\Ii} B_i\dar[shorten <=-0.75ex,"\tau"]\\
			C_i\rar & C_j\rar & D_j\rar &\colimit\limits_{i\in\Ii} D_i
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	We must show that the left square is a pullback. But the middle square is a pullback by assumption and the right one is a pullback by \itememph{\boxtimes}. Hence also the rectangle formed by the middle and the right square is a pullback. But then the same argument implies that also the rectangle formed by all three squares must be a pullback. By abstract pullback nonsense, this implies that the left square must be a pullback as well, as claimed. This shows that $\sigma$ is equifibred.
	
	Now consider the diagram
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=scriptsize]
			A_j\dar\rar\drar[dotted,pullback]   &\colimit\limits_{i\in\Ii}B_i\times_{\colimit_{i\in\Ii}D_i}\colimit\limits_{i\in\Ii}C_i\rar\dar[shorten <=-0.75ex]\drar[pullback] & \colimit\limits_{i\in\Ii} B_i\dar[shorten <=-0.75ex,"\tau"]\\
			C_j\rar & \colimit\limits_{i\in\Ii}C_i\rar &\colimit\limits_{i\in\Ii} D_i
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	The right square is a pullback by construction, and that the outer rectangle is a pullback was checked in the previous step. Hence again the left square is a pullback too for all $j\in \Ii$. But then \itememph{\boxtimes} applied to $\sigma$ implies that $\colimit_{i\in\Ii}B_i\times_{\colimit_{i\in\Ii}D_i}\colimit_{i\in\Ii}C_i\simeq \colimit_{i\in\Ii}A_i$ and we're done!
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch of \cref{thm:SpanF}]
	We split the proof into two major steps.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item[\itememph{1}] \itshape We construct an easily understood Segal anima $\operatorname{Null}(\Cc)\colon \IDelta^\op\morphism\An$ satisfying
		\begin{equation*}
			\asscat\big(F(\operatorname{Null}(\Cc))\big)\simeq 0/\Span^F(\Cc)
		\end{equation*}
	\end{alphanumerate}
	
	Consider the functor $[0]\star -\colon \IDelta^\op\morphism \IDelta^\op$. It induces a functor $\operatorname{d\acute{e}c}\colon \cat{sAn}\morphism \cat{sAn}$, called the \emph{décalage}. It already appeared in the proof of \cref{prop:HStronglyMonoidal}, although our convention there was to consider $-\star[0]$ instead (but who cares). The décalage functor comes equipped with natural transformations
	\begin{equation*}
		p\colon \operatorname{d\acute{e}c}\Longrightarrow \const\ev_0\quad\text{and}\quad d_0\colon \operatorname{d\acute{e}c} \Longrightarrow \id\,,
	\end{equation*}
	induced by $[0]\subseteq [0]\star [n]$ and $[n]\subseteq [0]\star [n]$ for all $[n]\in \IDelta^\op$, respectively. One easily checks that for every Segal anima $X$ and all $x\in X_0$ one has a commutative diagram
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\asscat\big(\fib_x(p\colon \operatorname{d\acute{e}c} X\morphism \const X_0)\big)\dar["d_0"']\rar[iso] & x/\asscat(X) \dlar[bend left=15]\\
			\asscat(X) & 
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	To see this, one first checks that $\fib_x(p\colon \operatorname{d\acute{e}c} X\morphism \const X_0)$ is Segal again, so the $\Hom$ anima in its associated category can be computed via \cref{eq:asscat2}. Once we understand the $\Hom$ anima in it, we find that $\asscat(\fib_x(p\colon \operatorname{d\acute{e}c} X\morphism \const X_0))$ has an initial element that's mapped to $x$ under $d_0$, hence $d_0$ lifts canonically to $x/\asscat(X)$. Then show that the lift is fully faithful and essentially surjective, again using that $\Hom$ anima can be calculated via \cref{eq:asscat2}. I leave the details to you since I'm too lazy to work them out.
	
	Now put 
	\begin{equation*}
		\operatorname{Null}(\Cc)\coloneqq \fib_0(p\colon \operatorname{d\acute{e}c}Q(\Cc)\rightarrow \const \Cc)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	So explicitly, $\operatorname{Null}_n(\Cc)\subseteq Q_{n+1}(\Cc)$ is the full sub-$\infty$-category spanned by diagrams of the following form:

	Moreover, since $p\colon \operatorname{d\acute{e}c}Q(\Cc)\rightarrow \const \Cc)$ is a degreewise split Verdier projection (with left/right Kan extension as adjoints, as usual), we have 
	\begin{equation*}
		F\big(\operatorname{Null}(\Cc)\big)\simeq \fib_0\big(p\colon \operatorname{d\acute{e}c}F (Q(\Cc))\rightarrow \const F(\Cc)\big)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Thus, our considerations above show $\asscat(F(\operatorname{Null}(\Cc)))\simeq 0/\Span^F(\Cc)$, as desired.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item[\itememph{2}]\itshape We show that there is a pullback diagram
		\begin{equation*}
			\begin{tikzcd}

			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{equation*}
		in which the right vertical arrow is equifibred in the sense of \cref{lemdef:Equifibred}.
	\end{alphanumerate}
	
	It is easy to see that the diagram above is indeed a pullback. Indeed, the pullback $\{0\}\times_{Q_n(\Cc)}\operatorname{Null}_n(\Cc)$ consists of diagrams of the form
	\begin{center}

	hence $\{0\}\times_{Q_n(\Cc)}\operatorname{Null}_n(\Cc)\simeq \Cc$. Moreover, $d_0\colon \operatorname{Null}_n(\Cc)\morphism Q_n(\Cc)$ is a split Verdier projection (with left/right Kan extension as adjoints, as usual), hence this pullback is preserved by $F$ and we obtain $\{0\}\times_{F(Q_n(\Cc))}F(\operatorname{Null}_n(\Cc))\simeq F(\Cc)$, as desired. This proves that we get a pullback diagram as above.
	
	If we can show that the right vertical arrow is equifibred, then we're done! Indeed, if this is the case, then \cref{lemdef:Equifibred} says that the diagram stays a pullback after applying $|\blank|\simeq \colimit_{\IDelta^\op}$. Hence we get a pullback
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\left|\const F(\Cc)\right|\rar\dar\drar[pullback] & \left|F\big(\operatorname{Null}(\Cc)\big)\right|\dar["\left|F(d_0)\right|"] \\
			\left|\const *\right|\rar["0"] & \left|F\big(Q(\Cc)\big)\right|
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	The upper left corner is $F(\Cc)$, which coincides with the anima $\Hom_{\Span^F(\Cc)}(0,0)$ as argued in the proof of \cref{lem:GrouplikeFunctors}. The lower left corner is clearly $*$. Applying \cref{rem:Realisation} to $\asscat(F(\operatorname{Null}(\Cc)))\simeq 0/\Span^F(\Cc)$ and $\asscat(F(Q(\Cc)))\simeq \Span^F(\Cc)$ shows that the upper and lower right corner coincide with $|0/\Span^F(\Cc)|\simeq *$ and $|\Span^F(\Cc)|$, hence the pullback diagram we get is precisely the one we want!
	
	It remains to show that $F(d_0)\colon F(\operatorname{Null}(\Cc))\morphism F(Q(\Cc))$ is equifibred. That is, we must show that
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			F\big(\operatorname{Null}_m(\Cc)\big)\rar\dar\drar[pullback] & F\big(\operatorname{Null}_n(\Cc)\big)\dar\\
			F\big(Q_m(\Cc)\big) \rar & F\big(Q_n(\Cc)\big)
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	is a pullback for every map $[m]\morphism{} [n]$ in $\IDelta^\op$. I think the way we did this in the lecture is too complicated and I can give a simpler proof. It seems almost too easy, so I feel a bit like I'm overlooking something, but I couldn't find anything. Please tell me if I'm wrong. 
	
	We've seen above that $\operatorname{Null}_n(\Cc)\morphism Q_n(\Cc)$ is a split Verdier projection with fibre $\Cc$. Hence, since $F$ is grouplike, \cref{par:MoreOnVerdierSequences}\itememph{d^*} implies $F(\operatorname{Null}_n(\Cc))\simeq F(Q_n(\Cc))\times F(\Cc)$, and likewise $F(\operatorname{Null}_m(\Cc))\simeq F(Q_m(\Cc))\times F(\Cc)$. So the pullback property is trivially satisfied.
	%In fact, it suffices to consider maps in $\IDelta^\op_\mathrm{inj}$, since the realisation of a simplicial anima coincides with its realisation as a semi-simplicial anima (see the proof of \cref{lem:SkeletalInduction}), so we can replace $F(\operatorname{Null}(\Cc))$ and $F(Q(\Cc))$ as well as $\const F(\Cc)$ and $\const *$ with their semi-simplicial restrictions. Moreover, since $F(\operatorname{Null}(\Cc))$ and $F(Q(\Cc))$ satisfy the Segal conditions, it's enough to check the pullback property for the three maps $d_0,d_1,d_2\colon [2]\morphism{} [1]$ in $\IDelta^\op_\mathrm{inj}$. For $d_1$ and $d_2$, the would-be pullback squares are split Verdier squares before applying $F$, hence they stay pullback squares. For $d_0$ instead, we get a diagram
	%\begin{equation*}
	%	\begin{tikzcd}
	%		\operatorname{Null}_2(\Cc)\rar\dar & 	\operatorname{Null}_1(\Cc)\dar\\
	%		Q_2(\Cc) \rar & Q_n(\Cc)
	%	\end{tikzcd}
	%\end{equation*}
	%whose horizontal (!) maps are split Verdier projections (for $\operatorname{Null}_2(\Cc)\morphism\operatorname{Null}_1(\Cc)$ this needs a bit of fiddling, since we can't just take Kan extensions as always, but it's not hard to write down the adjoints explicitly), but this diagram is not a pullback.
