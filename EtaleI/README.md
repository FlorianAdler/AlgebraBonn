# :warning: I won't be in Bonn on the 20th and 23rd Decembre, so I'm going to miss the last two Étale lectures in 2019!

This means **no lecture notes :fearful::grimacing:** ... unless :point_right:*you* help me out! I would very much appreciate if one of you could share their notes with me. You can just send a photo to my e-mail address ([ferdinand.wagner@uni-bonn.de](mailto:ferdinand.wagner@uni-bonn.de)). Of course you can also send me T<sub>E</sub>X code or even a pull request (well, less work for me), but I'm totally happy with ~any handwritten notes~ readable handwritten notes. 

**Merry Christmas :christmas_tree:!**
