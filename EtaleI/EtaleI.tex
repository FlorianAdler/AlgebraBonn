Bonn by Professor Jens Franke in the winter term (Wintersemester) 2019/20.

Some changes and some additions have been made by the author. To distinguish them from the lecture's actual contents, they are labelled with an asterisk.

\chapter{Preface}
\numpar*{Organizational stuff}As a result of a democratic decision in the preliminary meeting, the lecture will take place on Mondays from from 18:00 to 20:00 and on Fridays from 16:00 to 18:00, in the \enquote{Großer Hörsaal}.

Recommended prerequisites to this lecture are
\begin{temize}
	\item flat morphisms and faithfully flat descent,
	\item abelian varieties, in particular, the Jacobian of a curve.
\end{temize}
Nevertheless, Professor Franke promised to give a quick reminder on flat and étale morphisms in the first lecture. Moreover, typed lecture notes are available for Professor Franke's lecture on Jacobians of curves held in the winter term 2018/19 (see \cite{jacobians}). 

The goal of this lecture is to study the \emph{$\ell$-adic cohomology} of a scheme $X$, where $\ell\neq p$ is a prime different from the characteristic $p$ of $X$. These groups will be constructed as
\begin{align*}
	H_\et^i(X,\IZ_\ell)\coloneqq\limit_{n\geq 1}H^i(X_\et,\IZ/\ell^n\IZ)\,.
\end{align*}
Along the way, we will come across sheaves on the étale site, the relation between étale and Galois cohomology, cohomology of curves, and proper base change.

\numpar*{Author's note}
In these notes, the modern meaning of the word \emph{scheme} is used. That is, a scheme in these lecture notes is what Professor Franke would call a \emph{prescheme}, and what he would call a \emph{scheme} will be called a \emph{separated scheme} in here.

Also I will not follow Franke's numbering scheme\footnote{\ldots\ if not to say, numbering \emph{prescheme}.}, as I believe this document is easier to navigate if propositions/lemmas/etc.\ are numbered consecutively rather than independent of each other. 

\numpar*{\Attention\ Important note}\textbf{I won't be in Bonn on the 20th and 23rd Decembre, so I'm going to miss the last two Étale lectures in 2019!}This means \textbf{no lecture notes} \dotso unless \emph{you} help me out! I would very much appreciate if one of you could share their notes with me. You can just send a photo to my e-mail address \href{mailto:ferdinand.wagner@uni-bonn.de}{\texttt{ferdinand.wagner@uni-bonn.de}}. Of course you can also send me \TeX\ code or even a pull request (well, less work for me), but I'm perfectly happy with \sout{any handwritten notes} readable handwritten notes. Merry Christmas!

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$G$}{G}-Rings, Excellent Rings, and Universally Japanese Rings}
\lecture[More properties of henselization. $G$-, excellent, and universally Japanese Rings. The Artin approximation property. Some counterexamples.]{2019-11-29}In the rest of the section we collect some more properties of (strict) henselization and relate them to the notions of \emph{excellent} and \emph{universally Japanese} rings. Along the way we will stumble upon Artin's famous \emph{approximation theorem} and some more pieces of advanced commutative algebra.
\begin{fact}\label{fact:moarHenselization}
	The henselization and strict henselization of a local ring $A$ has the following properties.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item $A^\h$ and $A^\sh$ are faithfully flat $A$-algebras.
		\item If $A$ is noetherian, then $A$ has the property $R_k$ iff $A^\h$ has $R_k$ iff $A^\sh$ has $R_k$. The same is true for property $S_k$.
		\item If $A$ is noetherian and $\pp\in \Spec A^\h$ or $\pp\in\Spec A^\sh$, then $\pp\cap A$ is an associated prime of $A$ iff $\pp$ is already an associated prime ideal of $A^\h$ resp.\ $A^\sh$.
		\item The fibres of $\Spec A^\h\morphism \Spec A$ and $\Spec A^\sh\morphism \Spec A$ over some $\pp\in \Spec A$ are disjoint unions of spectra of separable field extensions of $\kappa(\pp)$.
		\item Henselization and strict henselization commute with filtered colimits of local rings along local ring morphisms.
		\item If $A$ is noetherian and universally catenary, then the same is true for $A^\h$ and $A^\sh$.
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{fact}
\begin{proof}[Sketch of a proof]
	Part \itememph{a} is easy: both $A^\h$ and $A^\sh$ are filtered colimits of flat $A$-algebras, hence flat themselves. Moreover, $A\morphism A^\h$ and $A\morphism A^\sh$ are local morphisms, hence even faithfully flat. We omit the proofs of \itememph{b} to \itememph{e}, but refer to \cite[(18.6)~and~(18.8)]{egaIV4}.
	
	For \itememph{f}, we verify the criterion from \cref{thm:universallyCatenary}\itememph{c} below. In the case of $A^\h$ and $\pp=0$ we can use the fact that $\roof{A}$ and $(A^\h)^\complete$ are isomorphic (see \cref{eq:AhComplete}). For general $\pp$, one uses the fact that $\pp$ already \enquote{comes from} some étale $A$-algebra $B_\lambda$ in the colimit $A^\h=\colimit_{\lambda\in\Lambda_0}B_\lambda$, i.e., there is some $\pp_\lambda\in\Spec B_\lambda$ such that $\pp=\pp_\lambda A^\h$. Indeed, $\pp$ is finitely generated as $A^\h$ is noetherian (\cref{prop:henselization}\itememph{e}), so all generators are already contained in some $B_\lambda$. The generated ideal $\pp_\lambda$ is necessarily prime. Indeed, $A^\h/\pp_\lambda A^\h\cong B_\lambda^h/\pp_\lambda B_\lambda ^\h\cong (B_\lambda/\pp_\lambda)^\h$ (using \cref{prop:henselization}\itememph{c}) is a domain and faithfully flat over $B_\lambda/\pp_\lambda$ by \itememph{a}. Now if $b\in B_\lambda/\pp_\lambda$ is a zero divisor and $I$ is the kernel of the multiplication map $b\colon B_\lambda/\pp_\lambda\morphism B_\lambda/\pp_\lambda$, then $I\otimes_{B_\lambda/\pp_\lambda}(B_\lambda/\pp_\lambda)^\h$ is the kernel of $b\colon (B_\lambda/\pp_\lambda)^\h\morphism (B_\lambda/\pp_\lambda)^\h$, which is nonzero as $(B_\lambda/\pp_\lambda)^\h$ is faithfully flat. Thus $b=0$ in $(B_\lambda/\pp_\lambda)^\h$. But then $(b)\otimes_{B_\lambda/\pp_\lambda}(B_\lambda/\pp_\lambda)^\h$ vanishes as well, proving $b=0$ since $(B_\lambda/\pp_\lambda)^\h$ is faithfully flat. This reduces the general case to the special case $\pp=0$ above.
	
	For the strict henselization, one can again reduce to the case $\pp=0$. Moreover, we use $(A^\sh)^\complete\cong (\roof{A}^\sh)^\complete$ (by \cref{eq:AshComplete}) to reduce to the case where $A$ is a complete domain. By Cohen's structure theorem (see \cite[\stackstag{032A}]{stacks-project}), $A$ is a quotient of a complete regular local ring $C$, hence $A^\sh$ is a quotient of $C^\sh$. Now $C^\sh$ is regular by \itememph{b}, hence universally catenary, thus $A^\sh$ is universally catenary too. Applying \cref{thm:universallyCatenary} backwards, we see that all irreducible components of $(A^\sh)^\complete$ have the same dimension, as required.
\end{proof}
\begin{thm}[Ratliff]\label{thm:universallyCatenary}
	For a noetherian local ring $A$, the following are equivalent:
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item $A$ is universally catenary, i.e., every $A$-algebra of finite type is catenary.
		\item $A[T]$ is catenary.
		\item For every prime ideal $\pp$, the irreducible components of $\Spec \big((A/\pp)^\complete\big)$ are all of the same dimension.
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	Omitted. See \cite[Theorem~31.7]{matsumuraCRT} or \cite[\stackstag{0AW1}]{stacks-project}.
\end{proof}
\begin{defi}\label{def:excellent}
	Recall the following notions from commutative algebra.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item A noetherian local ring $A$ is a \defemph{$G$-ring} if the geometric fibres $\roof{A}\otimes_A\ov{\kappa(\pp)}$ of the ring map $A\morphism \roof{A}$ are regular for every $\pp\in\Spec A$.
		\item A ring $A$ is called \defemph{excellent} if it is noetherian and universally catenary, all its local rings are $G$-rings, and for every $A$-algebra $B$ of finite type the regular locus $\left\{\pp\in\Spec B\st B_\pp\text{ is regular}\right\}$ is open in $\Spec B$ (rings with this property are called \enquote{$J$-2 rings}).
		\item A noetherian $A$ is \defemph{universally Japanese} if for every prime ideal $\pp\in\Spec A$ and any finite field extension $\ell$ of $\kappa(\pp)$ the normalization of $A/\pp$ in $\ell$ is a finitely generated $A$-module.
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{defi}
If $A$ is a local ring, then the last condition in \cref{def:excellent}\itememph{b}, i.e.\ $A$ being $J$-2, is an automatic consequence if $A$ is a $G$-ring (see the appendix, \cref{prop*:GJ-2} for a proof). Hence if $A$ is local, one only has to verify that $A$ is a $G$-ring and universally catenary.

In \cref{def:excellent}\itememph{c}, a hard theorem of Nagata shows that every $A$-algebra of finite type is universally Japanese too. A proof can be found in \cite[\stackstag{032E}]{stacks-project} (note that The Stacks Project calls rings with the property from \cref{def:excellent}\itememph{c} \defemph{Nagata rings}, so what they show is that \enquote{every Nagata ring is universally Japanese}). Moreover, if $A$ is excellent, then $A$ is universally Japanese (we prove this in \cref{prop*:quasi-excellentUniversallyJapanese}) and every $A$-algebra of finite type is excellent too.
\begin{exm}
	If $A$ is a DVR with quotient field $K$, then $A$ is regular, hence universally Japanese. As remarked above, for the local ring $A$ to be excellent it is necessary and sufficient that $A$ is a $G$-ring. The fibre over the special point $\mm\in\Spec A$ is trivial, so $\roof{A}\otimes_A\ov{K}$ is regular, hence only the generic fibre matters and we conclude that $A$ is excellent iff $\roof{A}\otimes_A\ov{K}$ is regular!
	
	If $\roof{K}$ denotes the quotient field of $\roof{A}$, then $\roof{A}\otimes_A\ov{K}\cong \roof{K}\otimes_K\ov{K}$ (because tensoring with $K$ is the same as localizing at a uniformizer $\pi\in A$). The latter is regular iff $\roof{K}$ contains no inseparable field extension of $K$, which is trivial in characteristic $0$. Being universally Japanese in this case is also equivalent to the same condition. Indeed, if you really dive into the proof of \cref{prop*:quasi-excellentUniversallyJapanese}, you find out that being universally Japanese is equivalent to $\roof{A}\otimes_AK\cong \roof{K}$ being geometrically reduced over $K$, which is pretty much the above condition. But honestly, I'm too lazy to work this out.
\end{exm}
The following fact has actually been given in the $13\ordinalth$ lecture, but I decided to relocate it since it seemed quite out of place (and Professor Franke likely just forgot to mention this).
\begin{fact}\label{fact:G-ringStuff}
	Let $A$ be a noetherian local ring.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item $A$ is universally Japanese iff $A^\h$ is universally Japanese.
		\item $A$ is a $G$-ring iff $A^\h$ is a $G$-ring. In this case $A^\sh$ is a $G$-ring as well.
		\item If $A$ is excellent, then so is $A^\h$.
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{fact}
\begin{proof}
	All but the second assertion of \itememph{b} are in \cite[(18.7)]{egaIV4}. Said second assertion is proved in \cite[\stackstag{07QR}]{stacks-project} or \cite[end of I.1]{kiehlfreitag}.
\end{proof}

\subsection{The Artin Approximation Property}
\begin{deflem}\label{deflem:AAP}
	A noetherian local ring has the \defemph{Artin approximation property} (AAP for short) if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item If $f_1,\dotsc,f_n\in A[X_1,\dotsc,X_m]$ and $\alpha\in \roof{A}^m$ satisfy $f_i(\alpha)=0$ for all $i=1,\dotsc,n$, then for every $s\in\IN$ there is an $a_s\in A^m$ such that $f_i(a_s)=0$ for all $i=1,\dotsc,n$ and such that the images of $a_s$ and $\alpha$ in $A/\mm^s\cong \roof{A}/\mm^s\roof{A}$ coincide.
		\item If $F\colon \cat{Alg}_A\morphism\cat{Set}$ is a functor that comits with filtered colimits, and if $\phi\in F(\roof{A})$, then for every $s\in\IN$ there is an $f_s\in F(A)$ such that the images of $f$ and $\phi$ in $F(A/\mm^s)\cong F(\roof{A}/\mm^s\roof{A})$ coincide.
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{deflem}
\begin{proof}
	We start with \itememph{a} $\Rightarrow$ \itememph{b}. Since $\roof{A}$ is a filtered colimit of its subalgebras $B$ of finite type over $A$, there is such a subalgebra $B\cong A[X_1,\dotsc,X_m]/(f_1,\dotsc,f_n)$ and an element $\phi'\in F(B)$ whose image in $F(\roof{A})$ equals $\phi$. The ring morphism $B\morphism A$ is given by an element $\alpha\in \roof{A}^m$ satisfying $f_i(\alpha)=0$ for $i=1,\dotsc,n$. By \itememph{a} there is an element $a_s\in A^m$ such that $f_i(a_s)=0$ and $a_s\equiv \alpha\mod \mm^s$. Let $\beta_s\colon B\morphism A$ be the morphism defined by $a$. Then $f=F(\beta_s)(\phi')\in F(A)$ satisfies the desired conditions.
	
	For \itememph{b} $\Rightarrow$ \itememph{a}, all we need to do is to consider the functor $F\colon \cat{Alg}_A\morphism\cat{Set}$ given by $F(B)=\left\{b\in B\st f_i(b)=0\text{ for all }i=1,\dotsc,n\right\}$. It's easy to check that this indeed commutes with filtered colimits.
\end{proof}
There is also a more general notion of having the AAP with respect to an ideal $I\subseteq A$. For more information, check out Guillaume Rond's paper \cite{Rond}. In the next few remarks we will derive some properties of rings having the AAP, construct some counterexamples, and finally link the AAP to the property of being excellent.
\begin{rem}\label{rem:AAPproperties}
	Let $A$ be a noetherian local ring with the AAP.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item $A$ is henselian. To see this, use the separatedness of the $\mm$-adic topology on $A$ to deduce \cref{prop:henselian}\itememph{f} from \cref{deflem:AAP}\itememph{a} and the fact that $\roof{A}$ is already henselian.
		\item If $A$ is reduced, then so is $\roof{A}$ (this follows immediately from \cref{deflem:AAP}\itememph{a}). Note that for $A^\h$ and $A^\sh$ this doesn't need the AAP, since it follows from \cref{fact:moarHenselization}\itememph{b} and Serre's criterion that a ring is reduced iff it is $R_0$ and $S_1$.
		\item If $\roof{A}$ is a domain, then $A$ is algebraically closed in $\roof{A}$ (this is just straightforward from \cref{deflem:AAP}\itememph{a}). \emph{Yes}, \emph{algebraically} and not just integrally! The polynomials in question need not be monic.
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{rem}
\begin{exm}
	Here are some examples of very well-behaved rings that yet do not have the AAP.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item This counterexample is due to Nagata. Or maybe F.K.\ Schmidt. Whatever the case, you should have a look at \cite{BGR}. Let $k$ be a field of characteristic $p>0$ such that $[k:k^p]$ is infinite. Consider the ring
		\begin{equation*}
			A=\left\{\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_iT^i\st
			\begin{tabular}{c}
				$a_i\in k$, and the subfield of $k$ generated by $k^p$\\
				and the $a_i$ is a finite field extension of $k^p$
			\end{tabular}\right\}\,.
		\end{equation*}
		Then $\roof{A}=k\llbracket T\rrbracket$ and $\roof{A}^p\subseteq A$, so \cref{rem:AAPproperties}\itememph{c} fails. This shows that $A$ is a DVR without the AAP. In this case the normalization of $A$ in $K(f)$ fails to be a finitely generated $A$ module for all $f\in k\llbracket T\rrbracket\setminus A$, where $K$ denotes the quotient field of $A$ (note that $f$ is integral over $K$ as $f^q\in K$).
		\item Let $x\in \IQ_p$ be transcendental over $\IQ$ and consider the ring
		\begin{equation*}
			A=\left\{f\in\IQ(T)\st f(x)\in\IZ_p\text{ and }f'(x)\in\IZ_p\right\}\,.
		\end{equation*}
		Then $A$ is a noetherian local ring and one has an isomorphism $\roof{A}\cong \IZ_p[T]/(T^2)$ sending $f\in \IQ[T]$ to the image of $f(x)+f'(x)T$. In this case, \cref{rem:AAPproperties}\itememph{b} fails, and the same holds after passing to $A^\h$ as $(A^\h)^\complete\cong \roof{A}$. Note that the normalization of $A$ in its field of quotients $\IQ(T)$ is $\left\{f\in\IQ(T)\st f(x)\in\IZ_p\right\}$, which is no finitely generated $A$-algebra.
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{exm}
\begin{rem}\label{rem:Popescu}\lecture[The Artin approximation theorem and its generalizations. The étale fundamental group of proper schemes over henselian noetherian local rings.]{2019-12-02}
	\emph{Popescu's theorem} is a celebrated result, which implies that every henselian noetherian local $G$-ring has the AAP (see \cite{Rond} or \cite[\stackstag{07BW}]{stacks-project} for proofs). Conversely, if a noetherian local ring has the AAP, then it is excellent, as proved by Rotthaus in \cite{Rotthaus}. In particular, a henselian $G$-ring is excellent, hence universally catenary (in fact, the latter is not that hard to show directly).
	
	Artin's original paper shows that if $A$ is the henselization (at an arbitrary prime ideal) of an algebra of finite type over a field or an excellent DVR, then $A$ has the AAP (see \cite[Theorem~(1.10)]{artinApprox}). This result is known as \emph{Artin's approximation theorem}.
\end{rem}
\begin{cor}
	Let $A$ be a local $G$-ring.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item $A^\h$ is a domain iff $\roof{A}$ is a domain.
		\item When $\roof{A}$ is a domain, $A^\h$ is the algebraic closure of $A$ in $\roof{A}$ (no, we are not talking about the integral closure here).
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
	Recall that $\roof{A}\cong (A^\h)^\complete$ by \cref{eq:AhComplete}. Thus if $\roof{A}$ is a domain, then so is $A^\h$ by faithful flatness. Conversely, assume $A^\h$ is a domain. By \cref{fact:G-ringStuff}\itememph{b}, $A^\h$ is a $G$-ring again, hence it has the AAP by Popescu's theorem. Consider the functor $F\colon\cat{Alg}_{A^\h}\morphism\cat{Set}$ given by
	\begin{equation*}
		F(B)=\left\{(b,b')\in B^2\st bb'=0\right\}\,.
	\end{equation*}
	It's clear that $F$ commutes with filtered colimits: if $(b,b')\in F(B)$, where $B=\colimit_{\lambda\in\Lambda}B_\lambda$ is a filtered colimit, then $b$ and $b$ are already contained in some $B_\lambda$, and their product must vanish in some $B_\mu$ for $\lambda\leq \mu$. So the AAP is applicable. Now if $F(\roof{A})$ contains a non-trivial element $(\alpha,\alpha')$ with $\alpha,\alpha'\neq 0$, then by the AAP there are elements $(a_s,a_s')\in F(A^\h)$ satisfying $a_sa_s'=0$. Moreover, for sufficiently large $s$ we have $a_s,a_s'\neq 0$, contradicting the assumption that $A^\h$ is a domain. This proves \itememph{a}.
	
	For \itememph{b}, note that étale $A$-algebras are quasi-finite, hence algebraic over $A$ (albeit not necessarily integral). Hence $A^\h$ is algebraic over $A$. Since $A^\h$ has the AAP by Popescu's theorem, \cref{rem:AAPproperties}\itememph{c} shows that it is algebraically closed in $\roof{A}$. This proves \itememph{b}.
\end{proof}
The most important application of Artin's approximation theorem to étale cohomology is the following corollary.
\begin{cor}\label{cor:pi1Proper}
	Let $A$ be a henselian noetherian local ring with residue field $k$ and let $X$ be a proper scheme over $S=\Spec A$. Further let $S_0=\Spec k$ and $X_0=X\times_SS_0$. Then the functor
	\begin{align*}
		\left\{\text{finite étale $X$-schemes}\right\}&\isomorphism \left\{\text{finite étale $X_0$-schemes}\right\}\\
		Y&\longmapsto Y_0=Y\times_XX_0
	\end{align*}
	is an equivalence of categories, and $\pi_0(X_0)\morphism\pi_0(X)$ is a bijection. Consequently, for all geometric points $x\morphism X_0$ we have an isomorphism $\pi_1^\et(X_0,x)\isomorphism\pi_1^\et(X,x)$.
\end{cor}
\begin{rem}
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item A heuristic reason why the proof of \cref{cor:pi1Proper} is relatively complicated (in that it uses heavy machinery like Artin's approximation theorem) is the following. Assuming there is a suitable \enquote{étale homotopy theory}, we would look at the exact sequence
		\begin{equation*}
		\pi_2^\et(S,x)\morphism\pi_1^\et(X_0,x)\morphism\pi_1^\et(X,x)\morphism\pi_1^\et(S,x)\,,
		\end{equation*}
		so we would need to investigate $\pi_2^\et(S,x)$, whatever that may be. At least so much can be said: $\pi_2^\et$ is even worse than in Algebraic Topology.
		\item A full proof of \cref{cor:pi1Proper} can be found in \cite[Arcata IV Prop.\:4.1]{sga4.5} or \cite[\stackstag{0A48}]{stacks-project}. In the case where the dimensions of the fibres of $X\morphism S$ are $\leq 1$, the use of the AAP may be bypassed; see \cite[Exposé~XIII Prop.\:2.1]{sga4.3}. Professor Franke does not know whether the AAP can be avoided in general.
		\item \cref{cor:pi1Proper} is a vast generalization of \cref{prop:pi1Henselian}, which is in fact the special case $X=S$.
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{rem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{cor:pi1Proper}]
	After filling in some details that Professor Franke (intentionally) left out, the proof has become quite long, so I decided to split it into five steps.
	
	\emph{Step~1.} We establish the assertion about connected components first. Recall that for a noetherian scheme $Y$, the set of connected components $\pi_0(Y)$ are encoded in $\Global(Y,\Oo_Y)$ as the \enquote{minimal} idempotents, i.e., those that do not divide any other idempotent. Let $X_n=X\times_S\Spec (A/\mm^{n+1})$ be the $n\ordinalth$ infinitesimal thickening of $X_0$. Using the baby case of Hensel's lemma for nilpotent ideals, we see that the idempotents of $\Global(X_0,\Oo_{X_0})$ are in canonical bijection with the idempotents of $\Global(X_n,\Oo_{X_n})$. By the theorem about formal functions, they are also in canonical bijection with the idempotents of
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:GlobalGlobalGlobal}
		\Global(X,\Oo_X)\otimes_A\roof{A}\cong \Global(X,\Oo_X)^\complete\cong \limit_{n\in\IN}\Global(X_n,\Oo_{X_n})\,.\tag{$*$}
	\end{equation}
	Since $X$ is proper over $S$, the ring of global sections $B=\Global(X,\Oo_X)$ is a finite $A$-algebra, hence a finite product of finite local $A$-algebras by \cref{prop:henselian}\itememph{c}, and its idempotents are in canonical bijection with the idempotents of $B/\mm B$. Since $\roof{A}$ is still henselian, ring $\roof{B}\cong B\otimes_A\roof{A}$ is likewise a product of local $\roof{A}$-algebras, and its idempotents of $\roof{B}$ are in canonical bijection with those of $\roof{B}/\mm\roof{B}\cong B/\mm B$. Now \cref{eq:GlobalGlobalGlobal} and the arguments before conclude the proof that $\pi_0(X_0)\isomorphism\pi_0(X)$ is an isomorphism.
	
	\emph{Step~2.} To show that the functor in question is fully faithful we would like to invoke \cref{lem:pi0}. Thus we only need to check that for finite étale $X$-schemes $Y$ the map $\pi_0(Y_0)\morphism\pi_0(Y)$ is bijective. But such a $Y$ is again proper over $S$, so the above argument can be applied again.
	
	\emph{Step~3.} For essential surjectivity, let $Y_0\morphism X_0$ be finite étale. By \cref{prop:thickeningEtaleEquivalence}, there are unique (up to unique isomorphism) finite étale $X_n$-schemes $Y_n$ such that $Y_n\times_{X_n}X_0\cong Y_0$. Uniqueness moreover tells us $Y_n\times_{X_n}X_{n-1}\cong Y_{n-1}$. Thus, $Y_n\cong \SPEC\Aa_n$, where $\Aa_n$ is a flat coherent $\Oo_{X_n}$-algebra, and $\Aa_n|_{X_{n-1}}\cong \Aa_{n-1}$. By Grothendieck's famous \emph{existence theorem} (see \cite[Théorème~(5.1.4)]{egaIII} for the concrete statement) the sequence $(\Aa_n)_{n\in\IN}$ gives rise to a unique coherent algebra $\roof{\Aa}$ on $\roof{X}=X\times_S\Spec \roof{A}$ satisfying $\Aa_n\cong \roof{\Aa}|_{X_n}$. We claim:
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item[\itememph{\boxtimes}] In our case, the coherent algebra $\roof{\Aa}$ is flat (hence locally free) and $\roof{Y}=\SPEC\roof{\Aa}$ is a finite étale $\roof{X}$-scheme.
	\end{alphanumerate}
	For the proof of flatness, it suffices to see that tensoring with $\roof{\Aa}$ preserves monomorphisms of coherent modules on $\roof{X}$. So let $\Ff\monomorphism \Gg$ be a monomorphism of coherent modules over $\roof{X}$ and consider $\phi\colon \Ff\otimes\roof{\Aa}\morphism \Gg\otimes\roof{\Aa}$. Since the $\Aa_n$ are flat over $X_n$ by assumption, pulling back to $X_n$ shows
	\begin{equation*}
		\ker\phi\subseteq\bigcap_{n\geq 1}\mm^n(\Ff\otimes\roof{\Aa})
	\end{equation*}
	By Krull's intersection theorem, this implies that the support $Z$ of $\ker\phi$ doesn't intersect the closed subset of $\roof{X}$ defined by $X_0$. But $\roof{X}\morphism \Spec\roof{A}$ is proper, so the image of $Z$ is closed because $Z$ is closed, hence the image contains the unique closed point $\mm\in\Spec \roof{A}$ unless $Z$ is empty. As $Z$ doesn't intersect $X_0$, this shows that $Z$ must be indeed empty. To get that $\roof{Y}$ is étale, we must show (\cref{prop:finiteEtale}) that the trace induces a perfect pairing
	\begin{equation*}
		\Tr_{\roof{\Aa}/\roof{X}}\colon \roof{\Aa}\times \roof{\Aa}\morphism\Oo_{\roof{X}}\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Knowing that $\roof{\Aa}$ is a vector bundle on $\roof{X}$, we may apply a similar argument as above to the kernel and cokernel of the induced map $\roof{\Aa}\morphism\Hhom_{\roof{X}}(\roof{\Aa},\Oo_{\roof{X}})$ to see that this is indeed an isomorphism. This shows \itememph{\boxtimes}.
	
	\emph{Step~4.} In the case where $A$ is complete, $X=\roof{X}$ and the proof of essential surjectivity is finished. Otherwise we must find a way to \enquote{descend} $\roof{Y}$ to a finite étale $X$-scheme $Y$. If $A$ already has the AAP (i.e., if $A$ is a $G$-ring by Popescu's theorem, see \cref{rem:Popescu}), this is easily done: consider the functor $F\colon \cat{Alg}_A\morphism\cat{Set}$ defined by
	\begin{equation*}
		F(B)=\left\{\text{isomorphism classes of étale coverings of $X_B=X\times_S\Spec B$}\right\}\,.
	\end{equation*}
	 If $F$ would commute with filtered colimits, then we could apply the AAP in the form of \cref{deflem:AAP}\itememph{b}, which straight up provides the desired étale covering of $X$. Proving that $F$ indeed commutes with filtered colimits is relatively easy but quite technical, so we give only a sketch: suppose we have $B=\colimit_{\lambda\in\Lambda}B_\lambda$ and $\Ss$ is a flat coherent $\Oo_{X_B}$-algebra such that $\SPEC\Ss\morphism X_B$ is an étale covering. Then $\Ss$ is a vector bundle, so by \cref{par:descendingFinPres}\itememph{d} it is the pullback of some vector bundle $\Ss_\lambda$ on $X_\lambda$. Choose finitely many local generators. Taking $\mu\geq \lambda$ large enough, we can achieve that the finitely many products (taken in $\Ss$) of these generators are already contained in the pullback $\Ss_\mu$ to $X_\mu$ and that $\Ss_\mu$ contains a global section that acts as a unit on all the chosen local generators. Then $\Ss_\mu$ has already an $\Oo_{X_\mu}$-algebra structure compatible with that of $\Ss$. Applying similar considerations to the kernel and cokernel of $\Ss\morphism\Hhom_{X_B}(\Ss,\Oo_{X_B})$ induced by the trace pairing, we see that these already vanish for $\Ss_\mu$ if $\mu$ is chosen large enough. So every étale covering of $X_B$ comes from an étale covering of some $X_\mu$. By similar arguments, every isomorphism between étale coverings of $X_B$ already exists on some \enquote{finite stage} (i.e., comes from some $X_\mu$). This more or less proves commutativity with filtered colimits.
	 
	 \emph{Step~5.} To remove the assumption that $A$ has the AAP, one applies a similar reduction as in our (sketched) proof that $F$ commutes with filtered colimits. Write $A=\colimit A_\alpha$ as a filtered colimit over its subalgebras $A_\alpha\subseteq A$ which are of finite type over $\IZ$. Using \cref{par:descendingFinPres}\itememph{e}, both $X\morphism S$ and $Y_0\morphism X_0$ may be written as limits over $X_\alpha\morphism S_\alpha$ and $(Y_\alpha)_0\morphism (X_\alpha)_0$ if $\alpha$ is large enough. By \cref{par:descendingFinPres}\itememph{e} and \itememph{f}, we may chose $\alpha$ even larger in order to achieve that both $X_\alpha\morphism S_\alpha$ and $(Y_\alpha)_0\morphism (X_\alpha)_0$ are proper resp.\ finite étale. Put $X'=X_\alpha$, $A'=A_\alpha$ and so one. Now have $A'$ of finite type over $\IZ$, together with a proper morphism $X'\morphism S'=\Spec A'$ and a finite étale morphism $Y_0'\morphism X_0'$ such that our original situation is the base change of our new situation along $S\morphism S'$. Let $\pp=\mm\cap A'$ and let $A''=(A'_{\pp})^\h$ be the henselization of $A'$  with respect to its prime ideal $\pp$. Define $X''$, $S''$ etc.\ accordingly. Since $A'_{\pp}$ is an algebra of essentially finite type over $\IQ$ or $\IZ_{(p)}$ (depending on whether $\mm\cap \IZ=(0)$ or $\mm\cap \IZ=(p)$) and $A''$ is its henselization, we see that $A''$ has the AAP by Artin's approximation theorem \cite[Theorem~(1.10)]{artinApprox}. So the argument from Step~4 is applicable and shows that $Y_0''\morphism X_0''$ comes from some finite étale morphism $Y''\morphism X''$. Since $A'\morphism A$ factors through $A''$ by naturality of henselization, we may base change $Y''$ along $S\morphism S''$ back to get $Y=Y''\times_{S''}S\morphism X$, which is an étale covering satisfying $Y\times_XX_0\cong Y_0$, as required.

\begin{cor}\label{cor:PicEpi}\lecture[Line bundles on proper curves over henselian noetherian local rings. Pushforward and pullback for étale sheaves.]{2019-12-06}
	Let $A$ be a henselian noetherian local ring with residue field $k$. Let $S=\Spec A$, $S_0=\Spec k$, and $X\morphism S$ a proper morphism such that the dimension of $X_0=X\times_SS_0$ is $\leq 1$. Then the canonical morphism
	\begin{equation*}
		\Pic(X)\epimorphism \Pic(X_0)
	\end{equation*}
	(given by pullback) is surjective.
\end{cor}
\begin{rem}
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item Here, $\Pic(X)$ denotes the set of isomorphism classes of line bundles on $X$, equipped with its canonical group structure given by the tensor product.
		\item Without the restriction that $\dim X_0\leq 1$, the assertion is wrong. For instance, $X\morphism S$ could be derived from $\xi\colon \XX\morphism \SS$, a universal surface over some moduli space of algebraic surfaces. Then the Hodge structure on $(R^2\xi_*\IZ)_s$ vanishes on complex points $s\in\SS(\IC)$, and if $S=\Spec \Oo_{\SS,s_0}^\h$ is the spectrum of the henselization of the local ring at some $s_0\in\SS$, one may be able to choose $c=c_1(\Ll_0)\in (R^2\xi_*\IZ)_{s_0}$ in such a way that it is a Hodge cycle at $s_0$ but there is no neighbourhood $U$ of $s_0$ such that $c$ is a Hodge cycle in $(R^2\xi_*\IZ)_s$ for $s\in U$. In that case, $\Ll_0$ is not in the image of $\Pic(X)\morphism\Pic(X_0)$.
		\item See \cite[Arcata~IV Prop.\:4.1]{sga4.5} for a proof that doesn't use the AAP and works already for morphisms $X\morphism S$ that are only separated and satisfy $\dim X_0\leq 1$.
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{rem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{cor:PicEpi}]
	Let $\roof{S}=\Spec \roof{A}$ and $\roof{X}=X\times_S\roof{S}$. Recall that we may identify $\Pic(Y)\cong H^1(Y_\Zar,\Oo_Y^\times)$ for all schemes $Y$.\footnote{Professor Franke required $Y$ to be quasi-compact and separated, so that \v Cech cohomology and sheaf cohomology coincide. This restriction doesn't make sense for two reasons: \itememph{1} even on quasi-compact separated schemes, $H^*$ and $\check{H}^*$ coincide only for quasi-coherent sheaves, which $\Oo_Y^\times$ is not; \itememph{2} however, $H^1$ and $\check{H}^1$ always coincide, on arbitrary spaces and for arbitrary sheaves!} Let $S_n=\Spec (A/\mm^{n+1})$ and $X_n=X\times_SS_n$ be the $n\ordinalth$ infinitesimal thickening of $X_0$. Topologically the $X_n$ all coincide; algebraically, for all $n\geq 1$ there is a coherent ideal $\Jj_n\subseteq \Oo_{X_n}$ defining $X_{n-1}$ as a closed subscheme of $X_n$. We have a short exact sequence
	\begin{equation*}
		1\morphism 1+\Jj_n\morphism \Oo_{X_n}^\times\morphism \Oo_{X_{n-1}}^\times\morphism 1\,.
	\end{equation*}
	As $\Jj_n^2=0$, the sheaf $1+\Jj_n$ (as a sheaf of abelian groups under multiplication) is isomorphic to $\Jj_n$ (as a sheaf of abelian groups via addition). Since sheaf cohomology only cares for the underlying topological space and the isomorphism class of the sheaf, we thus get an exact sequence
	\begin{equation*}
		\Pic(X_n)\morphism\Pic(X_{n-1})\morphism H^2(X_0,\Jj_n)
	\end{equation*}
	as part of the long exact sheaf cohomology sequence. Since $\dim X_0\leq 1$, Grothendieck's theorem on cohomological dimension shows $H^2(X_0,\Jj_n)=0$. Hence $\Pic(X_n)\morphism \Pic(X_{n-1})$ is surjective. Therefore, for every line bundle $\Ll_0$ on $X_0$ there is a sequence $(\Ll_n)_{n\in\IN}$ of line bundles $\Ll_n$ on $X_n$ satisfying $\Ll_n|_{X_{n-1}}\cong \Ll_{n-1}$. Using Grothendieck's existence theorem \cite[Théorème~(5.1.4)]{egaIII} we see that there is a line bundle $\roof{\Ll}$ on $\roof{X}$ with compatible isomorphisms $\roof{\Ll}|_{X_n}\cong \Ll_n$ (a priori $\roof{\Ll}$ is only coherent, but an argument as in Step~3 of the proof of \cref{cor:pi1Proper} shows that $\roof{\Ll}$ is automatically a line bundle).
	
	This immediately settles the case where $A$ is already complete. The case where $A$ has the AAP is only slightly harder: consider the functor $F\colon\cat{Alg}_A\morphism\cat{Set}$ given by
	\begin{equation*}
		F(B)=\Pic(X\times_S\Spec B)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	By a similar technical argument as in the proof of \cref{cor:pi1Proper}, $F$ commutes with filtered colimits. Therefore the AAP is applicable and we are done. For the general case we construct $A'$ and $A''$ as above, where $A'\subseteq A$ is a finite type $\IZ$-algebra and $A''$ its henselization at $\pp=\mm\cap A'$. Then $A''$ has the AAP by Artin's approximation theorem, so the previous argument applies, and to finish the proof we just base change back to $A$.
\end{proof}
\section{Direct and Inverse Images of Étale Sheaves}
\begin{con}\label{con:f_*}
	Let $f\colon X\morphism Y$ be a morphism of schemes. For any presheaf $\Ff$ on $X_\et$, let $f_*\Ff$ be the presheaf on $Y_\et$ defined by
	\begin{equation*}
		\Global(V,f_*\Ff)=\Global(X\times_YV,\Ff)
	\end{equation*}
	for étale $Y$-schemes $V$. This $f_*\Ff$ is called the \defemph{direct image} or \defemph{pushforward} of $\Ff$ under $f$, and it's easy to check that $f_*\colon \cat{PSh}(X_\et)\morphism \cat{PSh}(Y_\et)$ defines a functor between the presheaf categories.
	
	Note that $f_*$ restricts to a functor $f_*\colon \cat{Sh}(X_\et)\morphism\cat{Sh}(Y_\et)$. Indeed, let $\Ff$ be a sheaf, $V\morphism Y$ an étale morphism and $\{V_i\morphism V\}_{i\in I}$ an étale cover. We must show that
	\begin{equation*}
		\Global(V,f_*\Ff)\morphism\prod_{i\in I}\Global(V_i,f_*\Ff)\doublemorphism[p_1^*][p_2^*]\prod_{i,j\in I}\Global(V_i\times_VV_j,f_*\Ff)
	\end{equation*}
	is an equalizer diagram (I know, \cref{def:sheaf}\itememph{b} has a somewhat different condition, but we've seen---more or less---in the proof of \cref{prop:fpqcSheaf} that the sheaf axiom in the covering sieves formalism is equivalent to the above; also this is where covering families really become easier). Observe that $X\times_YV\morphism X$ is étale and $\{X\times_YV_i\morphism X\times_YV\}_{i\in I}$ is an étale cover again, because being étale and being jointly surjective is preserved under base change. Now plugging in the definition, the above diagram becomes a similar diagram for $\Ff$ and the chosen étale cover of $X\times_YV$, hence it is indeed an equalizer diagram by the sheaf axiom for $\Ff$.
\end{con}
\begin{rem}
	Pushforward of (pre)sheaves on larger étale sites might be studied in the same way. However, if you insist on working in a noetherian setting (as we do in the lecture), you should take some care to make sure that $X\times_YV$ stays (locally) noetherian.
\end{rem}
\begin{exm}
	If $x\colon \Spec \kappa(x)\morphism X$ is a geometric point of $X$ and $M$ is any set, there is a constant sheaf $\underline{M}$ on $(\Spec \kappa(x))_\et$ given by the sheafification of the constant $M$-valued presheaf. However, $\underline{M}$ can be easily described explicitly: since $\kappa(x)$ is separably closed, any étale $\kappa(x)$-scheme $U$ is just a disjoint union of copies of $\Spec \kappa(x)$. Thus, 
	\begin{equation*}
		\Global(U,\underline{M})=M^{\#U}\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Now $x_*\underline{M}$ is a \enquote{skyscraper sheaf} on $X_\et$. That is, for any étale $X$-scheme $U$ we have
	\begin{equation*}
		\Global(U,x_*\underline{M})=\prod_{u}M\,,
	\end{equation*}
	where the product is taken over all geometric points $u\colon \Spec \kappa(x)\morphism U$ lifting $x$. One easily checks that $\Ff\mapsto\Ff_x$ as a functor $\cat{Sh}(X_\et) \morphism\cat{Set}$ is left-adjoint to $M\mapsto x_*\underline{M}$ as a functor $\cat{Set}\morphism\cat{Sh}(X_\et)$.
\end{exm}
\begin{con}\label{con:f^*}
	In the situation of \cref{con:f_*}, let $\Gg$ be a presheaf on $Y_\et$. Define a presheaf $f^\sharp\Ff$ on $X_\et$ by
	\begin{equation*}
		\Global(U,f^\sharp\Gg)=\colimit_{U\in\Cc_U}\Global(V,\Ff)\,,
	\end{equation*}
	where the colimit is taken over the following category $\Cc_U$: the objects of $\Cc_U$ are commutative diagrams of the form
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			U\rar[dotted]\dar & V\dar[dotted]\\
			X\rar["f"] & Y
		\end{tikzcd}\,,
	\end{equation*}
	where $V\morphism Y$ is étale. The morphisms of $\Cc_U$ are morphisms $V\morphism V'$ of étale $Y$-schemes such that
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			& V\dar\\
			U \urar\rar & V'
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	commutes. If $U\morphism U'$ is a morphism of étale $X$-schemes, we have a functor $\Cc_{U'}\morphism\Cc_U$ sending any $(U'\morphism V\morphism Y)\in \Cc_{U'}$ to its composition with $U\morphism U'$. By the universal property of colimits, this gives a canonical morphism $\Global(U',f^\sharp \Gg)\morphism\Global(U,f^\sharp \Ff)$, turning $f^\sharp\Gg$ indeed into a presheaf on $X_\et$.
	
	In case $\Gg$ is already a sheaf, let $f^*\Gg=(f^\sharp\Gg)^\Sh$ be the sheafification of $f^\sharp\Gg$. This sheaf is called the \defemph{inverse image} or \defemph{pullback} of $\Gg$ under $f$.
\end{con}
\begin{fact}
	The category $\Cc_U$ is cofiltered. Therefore, the colimit defining $\Global(U,f^\sharp\Gg)$ is indeed a filtered colimit.
\end{fact}
\begin{proof}
	The arguments from the proof of \cref{fact:filtered} can be copied verbatim.
\end{proof}
\begin{rem}\label{rem:f^*}
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item Our construction of stalks is a special case of \cref{con:f^*}: if $x\colon \Spec\kappa(x)\morphism X$ is a geometric point of $X$, then there is a canonical isomorphism $\Global(\Spec \kappa(x),x^\sharp\Ff)\cong \Ff_x$.
		\item From the universal property of colimits, one derives a functorial bijection
		\begin{equation*}
			\Hom_{\cat{PSh}(X_\et)}(f^\sharp\Gg,\Ff)\cong \Hom_{\cat{PSh}(Y_\et)}(\Gg,f_*\Ff)
		\end{equation*}
		for presheaves $\Ff$ and $\Gg$. In other words, $f^\sharp\colon \cat{PSh}(Y_\et)\doublelrmorphism\cat{PSh}(X_\et)\noloc f_*$ is an adjoint pair of functors. In particular, there is a canonical isomorphism $g^\sharp f^\sharp\cong (fg)^\sharp$. Indeed, this is a formal consequence of the fact that $f_*g_*\cong (fg)_*$, which is easily verified.
		\item Since $f_*$ restricts to a functor $\cat{Sh}(X_\et)\morphism\cat{Sh}(Y_\et)$ and sheafification is left-adjoint to the forgetful functor from sheaves to presheaves, it's a formal consequence that
		\begin{equation*}
			\Hom_{\cat{Sh}(X_\et)}(f^*\Gg,\Ff)\cong \Hom_{\cat{Sh}(Y_\et)}(\Gg,f_*\Ff)
		\end{equation*}
		for sheaves $\Ff$ and $\Gg$, i.e., $f^*\colon \cat{Sh}(Y_\et)\doublelrmorphism\cat{Sh}(X_\et)\noloc f_*$ are adjoint functors as well. As in \itememph{b}, this formally implies that $g^*f^*\cong (fg)^*$ canonically. Thus, we have isomorphisms
		\begin{equation*}
			(f^\sharp \Gg)_x\cong \Gg_{f(x)}\cong (f^*\Gg)_x
		\end{equation*}
		for all geometric points $x\morphism X$. Here $f(x)$ denotes the composition $f\circ x\colon \Spec\kappa(x)\morphism Y$.
		\item For those of you who get off on coherence conditions, here is an explicit description of $f^*\Gg$: if $U\morphism X$ is étale, we have
		\begin{equation*}
			\Gamma(U,f^*\Gg)=\left\{(g_u)\in\prod_{u}\Gg_{f(u)}\st(g_u)\text{ fulfills the coherence condition\texttrademark}\right\}.
		\end{equation*}
		Herein, the coherence condition\texttrademark\ is the condition that the sieve of all étale morphisms $i\colon V\morphism U$ for which there exists an étale morphism $W\morphism Y$ fitting into a commutative diagram
		\begin{equation*}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				V\dar["i"']\ar[rr, "\phi"] & & W\dar\\
				U \rar& X\rar["f"] & Y 
			\end{tikzcd}\,,
		\end{equation*}
		together with an element $g_V\in \Global(W,\Gg)$ with the property that $g_{i(v)}$ equals the image of $g_V$ in $\Gg_{\phi(v)}$ for all geometric points $v\morphism V$, is a covering sieve. In particular, for all étale $U\morphism X$, the canonical morphism
		\begin{equation*}
		\Global(U,f^*\Gg)\monomorphism \prod_{u}\Gg_{f(u)}
		\end{equation*}
		is injective, with $u$ running over all geometric points of $U$.
		\item If $g\in\Global(Y,\Gg)$, then the element $(\text{image of $g$ in $\Gg_{f(u)}$})_u\in\prod_u\Gg_{f(u)}$ satisfies the coherence condition from \itememph{e}. This particular element will be denoted $f^*(g)\in \Global(X,f^*\Gg)$. Another way to think of $f^*(g)$ is as the image of $g$ in the colimit defining $\Global(X,f^\sharp\Gg)$ (see \cref{con:f^*}), which is then mapped to an element of $\Global(X,f^*\Gg)$ via the sheafification map $f^\sharp\Gg\morphism f^*\Gg$.
		\item In case $f\colon X\morphism Y$ is étale itself, $f^*\Gg$ and $f^*(g)$ are just the restrictions to $X$.

\begin{prop}\label{prop:etaleInverseLimit}\lecture[Interlude on inverse limits of schemes. Étale sheaves defined over an inverse limit.]{2019-12-09}
	Let $\{\xi_{\beta,\alpha}\colon X_\beta\morphism X_\alpha\}_{\alpha,\beta}$ be an inverse system of affine morphisms between noetherian (in particular, quasi-compact and quasi-separated) schemes. Put $X=\limit X_\alpha$, with structure morphisms $\xi_\alpha\colon X\morphism X_\alpha$. For some fixed $\alpha$, let $\Ff_\alpha$ be a sheaf on $(X_\alpha)_\et$ and $\Ff$ resp.\ $\Ff_\beta$ for $\beta\geq \alpha$ be its inverse images on $X$ resp.\ $X_\beta$. Then
	\begin{align*}
		\colimit_{\beta\geq \alpha}\Global(X_\beta,\Ff_\beta)&\isomorphism \Global(X,\Ff)\\
		\big(\text{image of }f_\beta\in\Global(X_\beta,\Ff_\beta)\big)&\longmapsto \xi_\beta^*(f_\beta)
	\end{align*}
	is a bijection. Here we use notation from using notation from \cref{rem:f^*}\itememph{e}.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	\emph{Step~1.} We show injectivity. Let $f\in\Global(X_\beta,\Ff_\beta)$ and $f\in \Global(X_{\beta'},\Ff_{\beta'})$ have the same image in $\Global(X,\Ff)$ (note that we can't just check for an element with image $0$ since we want to prove the assertion for sheaves of sets actually). We must show that there is some $\gamma\geq \beta,\beta'$ such that the images of $f$ and $f'$ in $\Global(X_\gamma,\Ff_\gamma)$ already coincide. Replacing $f$ and $f'$ by their images in $\Global(X_{\beta''},\Ff_{\beta''})$ for some $\beta''\geq \beta,\beta'$, we may assume $\beta=\beta'$. Let $x\morphism X_\beta$ be a geometric point whose underlying point $|x|$ is in the image of $|X|\morphism |X_\beta|$. Then there is a geometric point $y\morphism X$ such that
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\Spec \kappa(y)\dar\rar["y"] & X\dar["\xi_\beta"]\\
			\Spec \kappa(x) \rar["x"] & X_\beta
		\end{tikzcd} 
	\end{equation*}
	commutes. Hence the images of $f$ and $f'$ in $(\Ff_\beta)_x\cong \Ff_{\xi_\beta(y)}\cong \Ff_y$ coincide, as they are identified with the image of $\xi_\beta^*(f)=\xi_\beta^*(f')$ in $\Ff_y$. Thus, by definition of the stalk $(\Ff_\beta)_x$ as a filtered colimit, there is an étale neighbourhood $V\morphism X_\beta$ of $x$ such that $f|_V=f'|_V$. The image $U_x$ of $V\morphism X_\beta$ is open in $X_\beta$ by \cref{prop:ppfOpen}, and satisfies $f|_{U_x}=f'|_{U_x}$ because $V\morphism U_x$ is surjective, hence generates an étale covering sieve of $U_x$. Let $U\subseteq X_\beta$ be the union of all $U_x$ constructed in that fashion. Then the (Zariski-)sheaf axiom shows $f|_U=f'|_U$. Moreover $\xi_\beta\colon X\morphism X_\beta$ factors over $U$. Let $Z=X_\beta\setminus U$ equipped with any closed subscheme structure. Combining \itememph{a} and \itememph{b} from \cref{par:schemesInverseLimit} we see that $Z\times_{X_\beta}X\cong \limit_{\gamma\geq \beta} (Z\times_{X_\beta}X_\gamma)$ is empty, hence some $Z\times_{X_\beta}X_\gamma$ must be empty, so $X_\gamma\morphism X_\beta$ already factors through $U$. Then $f$ and $f'$ have the same image in $\Global(X_\gamma,\Ff_\gamma)$, as required.
	
	\emph{Step~2.} We show surjectivity. Let $f\in\Global(X,\Ff)$ be given. By construction of $\Ff$ as a pullback of $\Ff_\alpha$, there is
	\begin{numerate}
		\item an étale cover $\{U^{(i)}\morphism X\}_{i\in I}$, in which $I$ may be assumed to be finite since $X$ is quasi-compact by \cref{par:schemesInverseLimit}\itememph{b},
		\item together with étale morphisms $W^{(i)}\morphism X_\alpha$ that fit into a commutative diagram
		\begin{equation*}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				U^{(i)}\dar\rar & X\dar["\xi_\alpha"]\\
				W^{(i)}\rar & X_\alpha
			\end{tikzcd}\,,
		\end{equation*}
		\item together with elements $f^{(i)}\in \Global(W^{(i)},\Ff_\alpha)$,
	\end{numerate}
	such that $f|_{U^{(i)}}$ is the inverse image of $f^{(i)}$ under the map explained in \cref{rem:f^*}\itememph{e}. By \cref{par:descendingFinPres}\itememph{e}, all $U^{(i)}\morphism X$ are base changes of étale morphisms $U^{(i)}_{\beta_i}\morphism X_{\beta_i}$. Since there are only finitely many $i$, we may replace the $\beta_i$ by some $\beta\geq\beta_i$ for all $i\in I$. We are also free to increase $\alpha$. Thus we may assume all $U^{(i)}\morphism X$ are base changes of étale morphisms $U_\alpha^{(i)}\morphism X_\alpha$ with respect to $\xi_\alpha\colon X\morphism X_\alpha$. Applying a similar argument to the morphisms $U^{(i)}\morphism W^{(i)}\times_{X_\alpha}X$ obtained from the above diagram (observe that these morphisms are étale by \cref{fact:etaleProperties}\itememph{b}), we may assume that these already come from étale morphisms $U_\alpha^{(i)}\morphism W^{(i)}\times_{X_\alpha}X_\alpha\cong W^{(i)}$. Then $W^{(i)}$ may be replaced by $U_\alpha^{(i)}$ and the $f^{(i)}$ with their restrictions $f^{(i)}|_{U_\alpha^{(i)}}$ accordingly, so that we may finally assume
	\begin{equation*}
		U^{(i)}=W^{(i)}\times_{X_\alpha}X\,,
	\end{equation*}
	and the morphism $U^{(i)}\morphism W^{(i)}$ from the above diagram is just the projection to the first factor.
	
	For $i,j\in I$, let $p_1$ and $p_2$ be the projections from $W^{(i)}\times_{X_\alpha}W^{(j)}$ to its two factors. Then the preimages of $p_1^*(f^{(i)}),p_2^*(f^{(j)})\in \Global(W^{(i)}\times_{X_\alpha}W^{(j)},\Ff_\alpha)$ in the set $\Global(U^{(i)}\times_XU^{(j)},\Ff)$ coincide as they are both equal to the restriction of $f\in\Global(X,\Ff)$ along the étale morphism $U^{(i)}\times_XU^{(j)}\morphism X$. Applying the injectivity assertion that was proved in Step~1 with $X_\alpha$ replaced by $W^{(i)}\times_{X_\alpha}W^{(j)}$, we get some $\beta_{i,j}\geq \alpha$ with the property that $p_1^*(f^{(i)})$ and $p_2^*(f^{(j)})$ already coincide in $\Global(X_{\beta_{i,j}}\times_{X_\alpha}W^{(i)}\times_{X_\alpha}W^{(j)},\Ff_{\beta_{i,j}})$. Again, increasing $\alpha$  sufficiently much, we may assume without restriction that $\alpha=\beta_{i,j}$ for all $i,j\in I$. Thus $p_1^*(f^{(i)})=p_2^*(f^{(j)})$ for all $i,j\in I$, i.e., the elements $f^{(i)}\in \Global (W^{(i)},\Ff_\alpha)$ and $f^{(j)}\in \Global (W^{(j)},\Ff_\alpha)$ become equal upon restriction to $W^{(i)}\times_{X_\alpha}W^{(j)}$. Thus, by the sheaf axiom the elements $f^{(i)}$ may be pasted together to an element $f_\alpha\in\Global(U,\Ff_\alpha)$, where $U$ is the union over the images of $W^{(i)}\morphism X_\alpha$ (so $U$ is open by \cref{prop:ppfOpen}). Clearly $\xi_\alpha\colon X\morphism X_\alpha$ factors over $U$, hence so does $\xi_{\beta,\alpha}\colon X_\beta\morphism X_\alpha$ for some $\beta\geq \alpha$ by the argument from Step~1. Now the preimage $f_\beta=\xi_{\beta,\alpha}^*(f_\alpha)$ is an element of $\Global(X_\beta,\Ff_\beta)$, and it maps to $f$ by construction. This shows surjectivity.
\end{proof}
\begin{cor}
	Let $f\colon X\morphism Y$ be a morphism of schemes and $y\morphism Y$ a geometric point of $Y$. Put $X_y=X\times_Y\Spec\Oo_{Y_\et,y}$. Then
	\begin{equation*}
		(f_*\Ff)_y\cong \Global(X_y,\Ff)
	\end{equation*}
	canonically. Here $\Global(X_y,\Ff)$ is abuse of notation for $\Global(X_y,p_1^*\Ff)$, where $p_1\colon X_y\morphism X$ denotes the projection to the first factor.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof*}
	By \cref{prop:henselization}\itememph{g} and the construction \cref{eq:AhColim2} in its proof, we can write $\Oo_{Y_\et,y}\cong \Oo_{Y,|y|}^\sh\cong \colimit_{(V,v)}\Global(V,\Oo_V)$, where $(V,v)$ ranges through the affine étale neighbourhoods of the geometric point $y$. Thus $X_y\cong \limit_{(V,v)}X\times_YV$. Applying \cref{prop:etaleInverseLimit} hence gives
	\begin{equation*}
		\Global(X_y,\Ff)\cong \colimit_{(V,v)}\Global(X\times_YV,\Ff)\cong \colimit_{(V,v)}\Global(V,f_*\Ff)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	The colimit on the right-hand side is precisely $(f_*\Ff)_y$ (up to an easy cofinality argument to reduce to affine étale neighbourhoods).
\end{proof*}
