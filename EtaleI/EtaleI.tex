\maketitle
\noindent This text consists of notes on the lecture Advanced Topics in Algebraic Geometry (Étale Cohomology I), taught at the University of
Bonn by Professor Jens Franke in the winter term (Wintersemester) 2019/20.

Some changes and some additions have been made by the author. To distinguish them from the lecture's actual contents, they are labelled with an asterisk. So any \emph{Lemma}* or \emph{Remark}* or \emph{Proof}* that the reader might come across are wholly the author's responsibility.\\[\thmsep]Please report errors, typos etc.\ through the \emph{Issues} feature of GitHub.

\chapter{Preface}
\numpar*{Organizational stuff}As a result of a democratic decision in the preliminary meeting, the lecture will take place on Mondays from from 18:00 to 20:00 and on Fridays from 16:00 to 18:00, in the \enquote{Großer Hörsaal}.

Recommended prerequisites to this lecture are
\begin{temize}
	\item flat morphisms and faithfully flat descent,
	\item abelian varieties, in particular, the Jacobian of a curve.
\end{temize}
Nevertheless, Professor Franke promised to give a quick reminder on flat and étale morphisms in the first lecture. Moreover, typed lecture notes are available for Professor Franke's lecture on Jacobians of curves held in the winter term 2018/19 (see \cite{jacobians}). 

The goal of this lecture is to eventually define the \emph{$\ell$-adic cohomology} of a scheme $X$, where $\ell\neq p$ is a prime different from the characteristic $p$ of $X$. These groups will be constructed as
\begin{align*}
	H^i(X_\et,\IZ_\ell)\coloneqq\limit_{n\geq 1}H^i(X_\et,\IZ/\ell^n\IZ)\,.
\end{align*}
Along the way, we will come across sheaves on the étale site, the relation between étale and Galois cohomology, cohomology of curves, and proper base change.

\numpar*{Sequel on Weil I}
Professor Franke has confirmed there will be a follow-up lecture on Deligne's first proof of the Weil conjectures. It will take place on Tuesdays from 16:00 to 18:00 in a room tba, and on Fridays from  16:00 to 18:00 in the \enquote{Großer Hörsaal}. The plan is to present Deligne's proof in the very beginning, and then to work backwards through the proofs of the hard technical results required. So hopefully, the end of the sequel and the end of the current lecture will meet.

\numpar*{Author's note}
In these notes, the modern meaning of the word \emph{scheme} is used. That is, a scheme in these lecture notes is what Professor Franke would call a \emph{prescheme}, and what he would call a \emph{scheme} will be called a \emph{separated scheme} in here.

Also I will not follow Franke's numbering scheme\footnote{\ldots\ if not to say, numbering \emph{prescheme}.}, as I believe this document is easier to navigate if propositions/lemmas/etc.\ are numbered consecutively rather than independent of each other. 

%\numpar*{\Attention\ Important note}\textbf{I won't be in Bonn on the 20th and 23rd Decembre, so I'm going to miss the last two Étale lectures in 2019!}
%This means \textbf{no lecture notes} \dotso unless \emph{you} help me out! I would very much appreciate if one of you could share their notes with me. You can just send a photo to my e-mail address \href{mailto:ferdinand.wagner@uni-bonn.de}{\texttt{ferdinand.wagner@uni-bonn.de}}. Of course you can also send me \TeX\ code or even a pull request (well, less work for me), but I'm perfectly happy with \sout{any handwritten notes} readable handwritten notes. Merry Christmas!

\chapter{Proper Base Change}
\section{Formulation and Proof of the Main Theorem}
\numpar{}\label{par:pullbackMorphism}\lecture[]{2020-01-27}Let $f_X\colon X'\morphism X$ be a morphism of schemes. If $\Ff\in \cat{Ab}(X_\et)$ is an étale sheaf, we have a functorial morphism $f_X^*\colon \Global(X,\Ff)\morphism \Global(X',f_X^*\Ff)$. Applying the universal property of derived functors gives a pullback morphism
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pullback}
	f_X^*\colon H^\bullet(X_\et,\Ff)\morphism H^\bullet(X'_\et,f_X^*\Ff)
\end{equation}
of cohomological functors (note that the right-hand side is indeed a cohomological functor, because $f_X^*\colon \cat{Ab}(X_\et)\morphism \cat{Ab}(X'_\et)$ is exact). Now suppose $f_X$ sits in a pullback diagram
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}
		X'\rar["f_X"]\dar["p'"']\drar[pullback]& X\dar["p"]\\
		S'\rar["f"] & S
	\end{tikzcd}\,.
\end{equation*}
Let $U\in S_\et$. Applying \cref{eq:pullback} to $X'\times_SU\morphism X\times_SU$ instead and sheafifying with respect to $S_\et$ gives a canonical morphism
\begin{equation}\label{eq:baseChangeMorphism}
	f^*R^\bullet p_*\Ff\morphism R^\bullet p'_*f_X^*\Ff\,,
\end{equation}
called the \defemph{base change morphism}.
\begin{rem}\label{rem:baseChangeSpecialCases}
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item If $f$ is finite [TODO], then $R^if_{X,*}\Ff=0$ for all $i>0$, hence $H^i(X'_\et,f_X^*\Ff)\cong H^i(X_\et,f_{X,*}f_X^*\Ff)$ by [TODO: Leray] and \cref{eq:pullback} may be obtained by applying $H^\bullet(X_\et,-)$ to the unit $\Ff\morphism f_{X,*}f_X^*\Ff$ of the $f_X^*$-$f_{X,*}$ adjunction.
		\item A special case of \cref{eq:baseChangeMorphism} is the following: suppose $f=\ov{s}\colon S'=\Spec \kappa(\ov{s})\morphism S$ is a geometric point of $S$. Then the base change morphism takes the form
		\begin{equation*}
			(R^\bullet p_*\Ff)_{\ov{s}}\morphism H^\bullet\big(X_{\ov{s},\et},\pr_1^*\Ff\big)\,,
		\end{equation*}
		where $X_{\ov{s}}=X\times_S\Spec \kappa(\ov{s})$ and $\pr_1\colon X_{\ov{s}}\morphism X$ is the projection to the first factor.
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{rem}
\begin{thm}[Artin/Grothendieck]\label{thm:properBaseChange}
	Suppose we are in the situation of \cref{par:pullbackMorphism} (all schemes are not necessarily noetherian). If $p\colon X\morphism S$ is proper and $\Ff$ is a torsion sheaf on $X_\et$, then the base change morphism \cref{eq:baseChangeMorphism} is an isomorphism
	\begin{equation*}
		f^*R^i p_*\Ff\isomorphism R^i p'_*f_X^*\Ff
	\end{equation*}
	for all $i\geq 0$.
\end{thm}
\begin{cor}\label{cor:properBaseChange}
	If $p\colon X\morphism S$ is proper morphism and $S=\Spec A$, where $A$ is a strictly henselian local ring with residue field $k$. Let $\ov{s}\colon \Spec k\morphism S$ denote the corresponding geometric point. Then the canonical morphism
	\begin{equation*}
		H^i(X_\et,\Ff)\isomorphism H^i\big(X_{\ov{s},\et},\pr_1^*\Ff\big)
	\end{equation*}
	is an isomorphism for all $i\geq 0$, where $X_{\ov{s}}=X\times_S\Spec \kappa(\ov{s})$ and $\pr_1\colon X_{\ov{s}}\morphism X$ is the projection to the first factor.
\end{cor}
\begin{fact}
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item \cref{cor:properBaseChange} is the special case of \cref{thm:properBaseChange} applied in the situation of \cref{rem:baseChangeSpecialCases}\itememph{b}.
		\item Suppose $p=q\circ r$, where $q$ and $r$ are proper morphisms for which \cref{thm:properBaseChange} holds. [TODO: Motivation, Leray] We already pointed out that it suffices to treat the special case from \cref{rem:baseChangeSpecialCases}\itememph{b}.Then the assertion becomes
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{fact}
\begin{lem}
	\cref{cor:properBaseChange} holds in cohomological degrees $0$ and $1$ when $\dim X_{\ov{s}}\leq 1$ and $\Ff$ is a constant sheaf given by the finite abelian group $\Phi$. In higher degrees, one still gets a surjection
	\begin{equation*}
	H^i(X_\et,\Ff)\epimorphism H^i\big(X_{\ov{s},\et},\pr_1^*\Ff\big)
	\end{equation*}
	for all $i>1$.
\end{lem}
