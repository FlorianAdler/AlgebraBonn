Bonn by Professor Jens Franke in the winter term (Wintersemester) 2019/20.

Some changes and some additions have been made by the author. To distinguish them from the lecture's actual contents, they are labelled with an asterisk.

\chapter{Preface}
\numpar*{Organizational stuff}As a result of a democratic decision in the preliminary meeting, the lecture will take place on Mondays from from 18:00 to 20:00 and on Fridays from 16:00 to 18:00, in the \enquote{Großer Hörsaal}.

Recommended prerequisites to this lecture are
\begin{temize}
	\item flat morphisms and faithfully flat descent,
	\item abelian varieties, in particular, the Jacobian of a curve.
\end{temize}
Nevertheless, Professor Franke promised to give a quick reminder on flat and étale morphisms in the first lecture. Moreover, typed lecture notes are available for Professor Franke's lecture on Jacobians of curves held in the winter term 2018/19 (see \cite{jacobians}). 

The goal of this lecture is to study the \emph{$\ell$-adic cohomology} of a scheme $X$, where $\ell\neq p$ is a prime different from the characteristic $p$ of $X$. These groups will be constructed as
\begin{align*}
	H^i(X_\et,\IZ_\ell)\coloneqq\limit_{n\geq 1}H^i(X_\et,\IZ/\ell^n\IZ)\,.
\end{align*}
Along the way, we will come across sheaves on the étale site, the relation between étale and Galois cohomology, cohomology of curves, and proper base change.

\numpar*{Author's note}
In these notes, the modern meaning of the word \emph{scheme} is used. That is, a scheme in these lecture notes is what Professor Franke would call a \emph{prescheme}, and what he would call a \emph{scheme} will be called a \emph{separated scheme} in here.

Also I will not follow Franke's numbering scheme\footnote{\ldots\ if not to say, numbering \emph{prescheme}.}, as I believe this document is easier to navigate if propositions/lemmas/etc.\ are numbered consecutively rather than independent of each other.

\lecture[Injective objects in $\cat{Ab}(X_\et)$. Étale cohomology of schemes and morphisms. Some Leray-type spectral sequences.]{2019-12-16}Étale cohomology of schemes and morphisms between them will be constructed using the machinery of \defemph{right-derived functors}. We assume familiarity with the construction of the functors $R^iF$ for any left-exact functor $F$ between abelian categories. Since the $R^iF$ are usually computed via injective resolutions (provided such resolutions exist), it is useful to have the following proposition.
\begin{prop}\label{prop:enoughInjectives}
	Let $X$ be an arbitrary scheme.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item The category $\cat{Ab}(X_\et)$ of sheaves of abelian groups on $X_\et$ has sufficiently many injectives.
		\item If $j\colon U\morphism X$ is étale and $\Ii\in\cat{Ab}(X_\et)$ is injective, then $j^*\Ii\in\cat{Ab}(U_\et)$ is injective too.
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	The general way to do this is to use Grothendieck's \cite[Théorème~1.10.1]{tohoku}, but for this lecture Professor Franke prefers a down-to-the-earth approach.
	
	We begin with \itememph{a}. For a geometric point $\ov{x}$ of $X$, the functor $\ov{x}_*\colon \cat{Ab}\morphism \cat{Ab}(X_\et)$ of forming a \enquote{skyscraper sheaf} has the exact left-adjoint $(-)_{\ov{x}}\colon \cat{Ab}(X_\et)\morphism\cat{Ab}$ of forming the stalk at $\ov{x}$. Thus $\ov{x}_*$ preserves injective objects, i.e., if $I$ is an injective abelian group, then $\ov{x}_*I$ is injective in $\cat{Ab}(X_\et)$. Also recall $(\ov{x}_*I)_{\ov{x}}\cong I$. Now let $\Ff$ be an arbitrary abelian sheaf on $X_\et$. For every geometric point $\ov{x}$ choose an embedding $\Ff_{\ov{x}}\monomorphism I_{\ov{x}}$ into an injective abelian group, using that $\cat{Ab}$ has enough injectives. By the stalk-skyscraper adjunction, we get a morphism $\Ff\morphism \ov{x}_*I_{\ov{x}}$. Now consider
	\begin{equation*}
		\Ff\morphism\prod_{\ov{x}}\ov{x}_*I_{\ov{x}}\,,
	\end{equation*}
	where the product is taken over \enquote{all} (in the sense if \cref{rem:setTheory}) geometric points of $X$. The product on the right-hand side is a product of injective objects, hence injective itself. It remains to show that the morphism is injective. So let $\Kk$ be its kernel. Composing with the projection to the $x\ordinalth$ factor, we see that $\Kk$ lies in the kernel of $\Ff\morphism \ov{x}_*I_{\ov{x}}$. This kernel, however, vanishes at $\ov{x}$, hence $\Kk_{\ov{x}}=0$ for all chosen $\ov{x}$, proving that $\Kk=0$.
	
	For \itememph{b}, there are two approaches, which are both important on their own. One can use the fact that $j^*\ov{x}_*I\cong \bigoplus_{\ov{u}}\ov{u}_*I$, where the sum is taken over the preimages (in the sense of \cref{rem:WTFlyingOver}\itememph{1}) of $\ov{x}$ in $U$. In particular, this is a finite direct sum as $j$ is quasi-finite, so the right-hand side stays injective if $I$ is an injective abelian group. Then one may apply \cref{lem:injectiveStuff} below, using $\XX=\left\{\Ii\in\cat{Ab}(X_\et)\st j^*\Ii\text{ is injective in }\cat{Ab}(U_\et)\right\}$. Another proof uses \cref{prop:j!} and the fact that every functor having an exact left-adjoint preserves injectivity.
\end{proof}
\begin{lem}\label{lem:injectiveStuff}
	Let $\Aa$ be an abelian category and $\XX$ a class of objects of $\Aa$ such that the following two conditions are satisfied.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item If $x\in\XX$ and $y\morphism x$ is a split monomorphism, then also $y\in \XX$.
		\item For every object $a\in\Aa$ there is a monomorphism $a\monomorphism x$ with $x\in \XX$.
	\end{alphanumerate}
	Then $\XX$ contains all injective objects of $\Aa$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
	If $i$ is injective, then the monomorphism $i\morphism x$ from \itememph{b} splits, hence $i\in\XX$ by \itememph{a}.
\end{proof}
\begin{prop}\label{prop:j!}
	If $j\colon U\morphism X$ is étale, then $j^*\colon \cat{Ab}(X_\et)\morphism\cat{Ab}(U_\et)$ has an exact left-adjoint
	\begin{equation*}
		j_!\colon \cat{Ab}(U_\et)\morphism\cat{Ab}(X_\et)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Concretely, if $\ov{x}$ is a geometric point of $X$ and $\Ff\in\cat{Ab}(U_\et)$, then $(j_!\Ff)_{\ov{x}}\cong \bigoplus_{\ov{u}}\Ff_{\ov{u}}$, the sum being taken over all preimages of $\ov{x}$ in $U$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}[Sketch of a proof]
	We first construct a functor $j_\sharp$ between the presheaf categories, which is left-adjoint to $j^\sharp$ from \cref{con:f^*}. If $V\morphism X$ is étale, we put
	\begin{equation*}
		\Global(V,j_\sharp \Ff)=\bigoplus_{\phi\colon V\morphism U}\Global(V,\Ff)\,,
	\end{equation*}
	where the sum is taken over all factorizations $\phi\colon V\morphism U$ of $V\morphism X$ over $j$. The left-adjointness to $j^\sharp$ (which is a straightforward restriction functor in our case) as well as the formula for the stalks are verified by an easy calculation. Now define $j_!\Ff=(j_\sharp\Ff)^\Sh$. If follows that $j_!$ is indeed a left-adjoint of $j^*$. Exactness can be seen from the calculation of stalks.
\end{proof}
\begin{rem}
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item The formula for stalks in \cref{prop:j!} is left-adjoint to $j^*x_*I\cong \bigoplus_uu_*I$, which was used earlier in the proof of \cref{prop:enoughInjectives}.
		\item In the case of an open immersion $j\colon U\monomorphism X$, the formula for stalks shows that $j_!\Ff$ is the usual \enquote{extension by zero}.
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{rem}
\begin{defi}[\textsc{Finally!}]
	Let $X$ be an arbitrary scheme.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item We denote by $H^i(X_\et,-)$ the $i\ordinalth$ right-derived functor of the global sections functor $\Global(X,-)\colon \cat{Ab}(X_\et)\morphism\cat{Ab}$.
		\item For a morphism $f\colon X\morphism Y$ of schemes, let $R^if_*$ denote the $i\ordinalth$ right-derived functor of $f_*\colon \cat{Ab}(X_\et)\morphism\cat{Ab}(Y_\et)$. In case of ambiguity, we use subscripts $R^if_{\et,*}$ and $R^if_{\Zar,*}$ to distinguish between derived pushforward on étale and Zariski sites.
		\item Let $\zeta_{X,*}\colon \cat{Ab}(X_\et)\morphism\cat{Ab}(X_\Zar)$ denote the restriction to the Zariski site, i.e., for $\Ff\in\cat{Ab}(X_\et)$, the sheaf $\zeta_{X,*}\Ff$ is obtained by restricting $\Ff$ to Zariski opens of $X$. We let $R^i\zeta_{X,*}$ denote its right-derived functors.
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{defi}
\begin{rem}
	By \cref{prop:enoughInjectives}\itememph{b}, the functors $H^i(U_\et,j^*(-))\colon \cat{Ab}(X_\et)\morphism \cat{Ab}$ are the derived functors of $\Global(U,-)\colon \cat{Ab}(X_\et)\morphism\cat{Ab}$, the functor of taking sections over $U$.
\end{rem}
\begin{rem}
	If $\Oo$ is a sheaf of rings on $X_\et$, then $H^i(X_\et,-)$ are also the (underlying abelian groups of the) derived functors of $\Global(X,-)\colon \cat{Mod}_\Oo\morphism \cat{Mod}_{\Global(X,\Oo)}$. In the case of sheaves on topological spaces this is usually proved via \emph{flabby sheaves}, i.e., those $\Ff$ for which $\Global(U,\Ff)\epimorphism \Global(V,\Ff)$ is surjective whenever $V\subseteq U$ are open subsets. One shows that cohomology can be computed via flabby resolutions and then everything is clear since being flabby is preserved under the forgetful functor $\cat{Mod}_\Oo\morphism\cat{Ab}(X)$.
	
	However, this argument no longer works. For example, injective sheaves $\Ii$ on $X_\et$ are no longer \enquote{flabby} (in the naive sense that $\Global(U,\Ii)\epimorphism \Global(V,\Ii)$ is surjective when $V\morphism U$ is étale), the problem being that $j_!\IZ_U\morphism \IZ_X$ is no longer a monomorphism (which is the essential ingredient in \cite[\stackstag{01EA}]{stacks-project}) because there can be more than one geometric point of $U$ over a given geometric point of $X$.
	
	Instead, the proof in \cite[\stackstag{03FA}]{stacks-project} uses \v Cech cohomology arguments. As Robin pointed out, there is better notion of \enquote{flabby sheaves} that works for arbitrary sites, called \defemph{limp sheaves} by The Stacks Project and \defemph{flasque sheaves} by \cite[Exposé~V.4]{sga4.2}.
\end{rem}
\begin{rem}
	For $\Ff\in\cat{Ab}(X_\et)$, the sheaf $R^if_*\Ff$ is the sheafification of the presheaf $V\mapsto H^i((X\times_YV)_\et,\Ff)$ for $V\morphism Y$ étale. Here $\Ff$ should actually be replaced by the pullback of $\Ff$ to $X\times_VY$, but such abuse of notation is very convenient and we will use it frequently.
	
	To see why the assertion is true, let $\Phi^i$ denote the functors described above. Then the sequence $(\Phi^i)_{i\geq 0}$ forms a cohomological functor (i.e., takes short exact sequences to a long exact sequence), $\Phi^0$ agrees with $R^0f_*$, and $\Phi^i$ kills injective objects of $\cat{Ab}(X_\et)$ for all $i>0$ by \cref{prop:enoughInjectives}\itememph{b}. It is a well-known fact that in such a situation the $\Phi^i$ are indeed the derived functors of $f_*$. For some reason, Professor Franke decided to write down a very general version of said fact in \cref{prop:effacable} below.
\end{rem}
\begin{prop}\label{prop:effacable}
	Let $\Aa$ and $\Bb$ be abelian categories.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item Let $(\Phi^i)_{i\geq 0}\colon \Aa\morphism\Bb$ be a cohomological functor. Then the $\Phi^i$ are the derived functors of $F=\Phi^0$ if one of the following \enquote{effaceability conditions} holds:
		\begin{numerate}
			\item If $\Bb=\cat{Mod}_R$ is the category of modules over a ring, then it is sufficient that for every $i>0$, all $a\in\Aa$, and all $f\in \Phi^i(a)$, there is a monomorphism $j\colon a\monomorphism b$ in $\Aa$ such that $\Phi^i(j)(f)=0$.
			\item If $\Bb=\cat{Mod}_\Oo$ is the category of modules over a sheaf of rings $\Oo$ on a topological space $X$ or on $X_\et$, then it suffices that for every (geometric) point $x$ of $X$, all $i>0$, every $a\in \Aa$, and every $f\in \Phi^i(a)_x$, there is a monomorphism $j\colon a\monomorphism b$ in $\Aa$ such that $\Phi^i(j)(f)=0$.
			\item If $\Bb$ is arbitrary, we need that for every $i>0$ and all $a\in\Aa$ there is a monomorphism $j\colon a\monomorphism b$ such that $\Phi^i(j)=0$.
			\item If $\Bb$ is arbitrary and $\Aa$ has enough injectives, it suffices to have $\Phi^i(a)=0$ whenever $a\in \Aa$ is injective.
		\end{numerate}
		\item Assume $\Aa$ has sufficiently many injectives. Let $F\colon \Aa\morphism \Bb$ be a left-exact functor and $\XX\subseteq \Aa$ a class of objects satisfying the conditions from \cref{lem:injectiveStuff} and in addition
		\begin{alphanumerate}
			\item[\itememph{*}] If $0\morphism x'\morphism x\morphism x''\morphism 0$ is exact in $\Aa$ and $x',x\in \XX$, then also $x''\in \XX$ and $Fx\morphism Fx'$ is an epimorphism.
		\end{alphanumerate}
		Then every injective object of $\Aa$ is in $\XX$ and $R^iF(x)=0$ for $x\in \XX$.
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof*}[Sketch of a proof]
	Conditions \itememph{3} and \itememph{4} of \itememph{a} are well-known effaceability criteria from \cite[Chapitre~II]{tohoku}. To see that the weaker criteria \itememph{1} and \itememph{2} hold, go through the proof of \itememph{3} in this particular special case and generalize where necessary.
	
	For \itememph{b}, we already know that $\XX$ contains all injective objects since we proved this in \cref{lem:injectiveStuff}. Now let $x\in \XX$. We can choose a short exact sequence $0\morphism x\morphism t\morphism c\morphism 0$ with $t$ injective. By \itememph{*} we have $c\in \XX$ as well, and since $t$ is injective, we get $R^iF(c)\cong R^{i+1}F(x)$ for all $i>0$ from the long exact derived functor sequence. Thus it suffices to prove $R^1F(x)=0$. But $F(t)\morphism F(c)$ is an epimorphism \itememph{*}, hence $R^1F(t)=0$ and the long exact sequence show $R^1F(x)=0$, as required.
\end{proof*}
\begin{prop}\label{prop:etaleLeray}
	If $f\colon X\morphism Y$ and $g\colon Y\morphism Z$ are morphisms of schemes, then we have three Leray spectral sequences
	\begin{gather*}
		E_2^{p,q}=H^p(Y_\et,R^qf_*\Ff)\converge H^{p+q}(X_\et,\Ff)\,,  \quad E_2^{p,q}=R^pg_*R^qf_*\Ff\converge R^{p+q}(gf)_*\Ff\,,\\
		E_2^{p,q}=H^p(X_\Zar,R^q\zeta_{X,*}\Ff)\converge H^{p+q}(X_\et,\Ff)\,.
	\end{gather*}
	Moreover, if $F\colon \cat{Ab}(X_\et)\morphism\cat{Ab}(Y_\Zar)$ denotes the \enquote{forgetful pushforward} functor, then there are two spectral sequences\footnote{In the lecture we had a single spectral sequence $E_2^{p,q}=R^pf_{\Zar,*}R^q\zeta_{X,*}\Ff\converge \zeta_{Y,*}R^{p+q}f_{\et,*}\Ff$, suggesting that the second of the above spectral sequences collapses. Unfortunately, this is not true (I asked Professor Franke).}
	\begin{equation*}
		E_2^{p,q}=R^pf_{\Zar,*}R^q\zeta_{X,*}\Ff\converge R^{p+q}F(\Ff)\,,\quad E_2^{p,q}=R^p\zeta_{Y,*}R^qf_{\et,*}\Ff\converge R^{p+q}F(\Ff)\,.
	\end{equation*}
\end{prop}
\noindent\emph{Proof.}\lecture[Proof of \cref{prop:etaleLeray}. Étale cohomology and Galois cohomology. Thanks to Konrad for sharing his lecture notes!]{2019-12-20}All of these become instances of the Grothendieck spectral sequence once we show that $f_*$ and $\zeta_{X,*}$ map injective objects to acyclic ones (with respect to the respective second functor). In fact, both $f_*$ and $\zeta_{X,*}$ even preserve injective objects! For $f_*$ the reason is that it has the exact left-adjoint $f^*\colon \cat{Ab}(Y_\et)\morphism \cat{Ab}(X_\et)$. For $\zeta_{X,*}$, there are at least two possible approaches:
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item Construct an exact left-adjoint $\zeta_X^*\colon \cat{Ab}(X_\Zar)\morphism \cat{Ab}(X_\et)$. To do so, we first define an adjoint $\zeta_X^\sharp\colon \cat{PAb}(X_\Zar)\morphism\cat{PAb}(X_\et)$ of the forgetful functor $\cat{PAb}(X_\et)\morphism\cat{PAb}(X_\Zar)$. Similar to \cref{con:f^*} we define it via
		\begin{equation*}
		\Global(U,\zeta_X^\sharp\Gg)\coloneqq \colimit_V\Global(V,\Gg)=\Global(\text{image of $U\rightarrow X$},\Gg)\,.
		\end{equation*}
		The colimit in the middle is taken over all Zariski-open subsets $V\subseteq X$ containing the image of $U\morphism X$. But since every étale morphism $U\morphism X$ has open image by \cref{prop:ppfOpen}, we get the equality on the right (and thus a much simpler description of $\zeta_X^\sharp$). It's easy to see that $\zeta_X^\sharp$ has the required property. Then $\zeta_X^*=(\zeta_X^\sharp)^\Sh$ is a left-adjoint of $\zeta_{X,*}$. If $\ov{x}$ is a geometric point of $X$ with underlying point $x$, then $(\zeta_X^*\Gg)_{\ov{x}}\cong (\zeta_X^\sharp\Gg)_{\ov{x}}\cong \Gg_x$, so $\zeta_X^*$ is indeed exact.
		\item If $\ov{x}$ and $x$ are as above, show that $\zeta_{X,*}\ov{x}_*I\cong x_*I$ for injective abelian groups $I$. Thus $\zeta_{X,*}\Ii$ stays injective if $\Ii$ is one of the injective objects from the proof of \cref{prop:enoughInjectives}. Since there are sufficiently many of them, this suffices to provide us with the required spectral sequence.
	\end{alphanumerate}
	Whichever approach you prefer, this finishes the proof.\qed
\begin{prop}
	If $f\colon X\morphism Y$ is a finite morphism of schemes, then $R^pf_*\Ff=0$ for all $p>0$ and all sheaves $\Ff$ on $X_\et$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	For geometric points $\ov{y}$ of $Y$ we have $(f_*\Ff)_{\ov{y}}\cong \prod_{\ov{x}}\Ff_{\ov{x}}$ by \cref{cor:(f_*F)_y} (with notation as explained there). Since exactness can be checked on stalks at geometric points, this shows that $f_*$ is an exact functor, whence its higher derived functors vanish.
\end{proof}
\section{The Relation with Galois Cohomology}
\begin{rem}\label{rem:GaloisAction}
	Let $X$ be an arbitrary scheme and $\ov{x}\colon \Spec \kappa(\ov{x})\morphism X$ a geometric point with underlying point $x\in X$. We may identify $\kappa(x)$ with its image in $\kappa(\ov{x})$. Moreover, we have seen in \cref{rem:setTheory} that replacing $\kappa(\ov{x})$ by the separable closure $\kappa(x)^\sep$ of $\kappa(x)$ in it neither changes stalks nor étale neighbourhoods, so we may assume $\kappa(\ov{x})=\kappa(x)^\sep$. If $\sigma\in G_x\coloneqq \Gal(\kappa(\ov{x})/\kappa(x))$ and $(U,\ov{u})$ is an étale neighbourhood of $\ov{x}$, then also $(U,\ov{u}\circ \Spec(\sigma))$ is also a preimage of $\ov{x}$ in $U$. We thus get an action of $G_x$ on the category of étale neighbourhoods of $\ov{x}$ via
	\begin{equation*}
		\sigma\colon (U,\ov{u})\longmapsto \big(U,\ov{u}\circ \Spec(\sigma)\big)\,!
	\end{equation*}
	Now if $\Ff$ is a sheaf on $X_\et$, then the action of $G_x$ on the étale neighbourhoods induces an action on the stalk $\Ff_{\ov{x}}$, sending the image of $\phi\in \Global(U,\Ff)$ via $\ov{u}$ to the image of $\phi$ via $\ov{u}\circ \Spec(\sigma)$. It follows that the image of $\Global(X,\Ff)$ is contained in the subset of $G_x$-invariants $\Ff_{\ov{x}}^{G_x}\subseteq \Ff_{\ov{x}}$.
	
	This action of $G_x$ on the set of lifts $\ov{u}$ of $\ov{x}$ to an étale $X$-scheme $U$ is compatible with morphisms $f\colon U\morphism U'$ in $X_\et$ in the sense that $\sigma f(\ov{u})=f(\sigma \ov{u})$, and if $j\colon U\morphism X$ is étale, then the image of $\Global(U,\Ff)$ in $\prod_{j(\ov{u})=\ov{x}}\Ff_{\ov{x}}$ (the product is taken over all lifts of $\ov{x}$ to $U$) is contained in the subset $\big\{(\phi_{\ov{u}})\in \prod_{\ov{u}}\Ff_{\ov{x}}\ \big|\ \phi_{\sigma \ov{u}}=\sigma \phi_{\ov{u}}\big\}$ (here $\sigma$ denotes both the action on geometric points and on $\Ff_{\ov{x}}$ by abuse of notation).
\end{rem}
\begin{prop}\label{prop:etaleGalois}
	Let $X=\Spec k$ be the spectrum of a field and consider the geometric point $\ov{x}\colon \Spec k^\sep\morphism X$. Let $G=\Gal(k^\sep/k)$ be the absolute Galois group of $k$ and let $G\cat{\mhyph Mod}$ be the category of discrete abelian groups with a continuous $G$-action.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item We have an equivalence of categories
		\begin{align*}
			\cat{Ab}(X_\et)&\isomorphism G\cat{\mhyph Mod}\\
			\Ff&\longmapsto \Ff_{\ov{x}}\,.
		\end{align*}
		\item Similarly, there are equivalences of categories $\cat{Sh}(X_\et)\cong G\cat{\mhyph Set}$ and $\cat{Grp}(X_\et)\cong G\cat{\mhyph Grp}$ between the categories of sheaves of sets/groups on $X_\et$ and the categories of discrete sets/groups with a continuous $G$-action.
		\item There is a canonical isomorphism $H^i(X_\et,\Ff)\cong H^i(G,\Ff_{\ov{x}})$ of cohomological functors on $\cat{Ab}(X_\et)$. Here $H^i(G,-)$ denotes the right-derived functor of $(-)^G\colon G\cat{\mhyph Mod}\morphism G\cat{\mhyph Mod}$ (also known as \enquote{group cohomology}).
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}[Sketch of a proof]
	We prove \itememph{a} and \itememph{b} by constructing a quasi-inverse functor in each of these cases. If $F$ is a discrete set or (abelian) group with a continuous $G$-action, let $\Ff_F$ be the sheaf given by
	\begin{equation*}
		\Global(U,\Ff_F)=\left\{(\phi_{\ov{u}})\in \prod_{\ov{u}}F\st \phi_{\sigma\ov{u}}=\sigma \phi_{\ov{u}}\right\}\,,
	\end{equation*}
	where $\ov{u}$ ranges over the lifts of $\ov{x}$ to $U$. If $j\colon V\morphism U$ is a morphism in $X_\et$ then the restriction of $\phi\in \Global(U,\Ff)$ to $V$ is given by $\phi|_V=(\phi_{j(\ov{v})})$ where $\ov{v}$ ranges over the lifts of $\ov{x}$ to $V$.
	
	This sheaf satisfies $(\Ff)_{\ov{x}}$. Indeed, the category of étale neighbourhoods of $\ov{x}$ has a cofinal subsystem of objects $(U,\ov{u})$, where $U=\Spec \ell$. In this case $G$ acts transitively on the lifts of $\ov{x}$ to $U$. Thus, projecting to the $\ov{u}\ordinalth$ factor provides an isomorphism $\Global(U,\Ff_F)\cong F$ in this case, and then the same follows for the stalk $\Ff_{\ov{x}}$ after taking colimits.
	
	Conversely, if $F=\Ff_{\ov{x}}$, then \cref{rem:GaloisAction} gives a canonical morphism $\Ff\morphism \Ff_F$. As we have just seen, this induces an isomorphism $\Ff_{\ov{x}}=F\cong(\Ff_F)_{\ov{x}}$ on stalks at $\ov{x}$. But $\ov{x}$ is the only geometric point of $X=\Spec k$, hence $\Ff\isomorphism\Ff_F$ must be an isomorphism by \cref{prop:etaleStalks}\itememph{e}. This proves \itememph{a} and \itememph{b}.
	
	For \itememph{c}, it suffices to show that the equivalence of categories $\cat{Ab}(X_\et)\cong G\cat{\mhyph Mod}$ from \itememph{a} identifies the functors $\Global(X,-)$ and $(-)^G$. Indeed, if $F\in G\cat{\mhyph Mod}$, then 
	\begin{equation*}
		\Global(X,\Ff_F)=\left\{\phi\in F\st \phi=\sigma \phi\right\}=F^G\,,
	\end{equation*}
	because $G=\Gal(k^\sep/k)$ acts trivially on the lifts of $\ov{x}$ to $X$ (because, well, there's only one). This proves \itememph{c}.
\end{proof}
\cref{prop:etaleGalois} shows that the étale cohomology of a point can be computed by Galois cohomology. Thus, in the rest of this section we compute some Galois cohomology groups.
\begin{prop}
	Let $L/K$ be a Galois extension.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item We have $H^1(\Gal(L/K),L^\times)=0$ (this is famously known as \enquote{Hilbert's theorem 90}).
		\item We have $H^2(\Gal(L/K),L^\times)=\left\{[A]\in\operatorname{Br}(K)\st A\text{ splits over }L\right\}$.
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	Part~\itememph{a} is proved in \cref{cor:Hilbert90} assuming the special case that $L=L^\sep$ is separably closed (and thus a separable closure of $K$). The general case can be deduced as follows: putting $G=\Gal(L^\sep/K)$, we see that $H=\Gal(L^\sep/L)$ is a closed subgroup of the pro-finite group $G$ and $G/H\cong \Gal(L/K)$. Consider the Hochschild--Serre spectral sequence
	\begin{equation*}
		E_2^{p,q}=H^p\big(G/H,H^q(H,L^{\sep,\times})\big)\converge H^{p+q}\big(G,L^{\sep,\times}\big)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	From \cref{cor:Hilbert90} we know $H^1(G,L^{\sep,\times})=0=H^1(H,L^{\sep,\times})$. Thus $E_2^{0,1}=0$. Hence the above spectral sequence shows $H^1(\Gal(L/K),L^\times)=E_2^{1,0}\cong H^1(G,L^{\sep,\times})=0$, as claimed. We omit the proof of part~\itememph{b}.
\end{proof}
\begin{defi}
	We say a field $k$ \defemph{has property $C_n$} if any homogeneous polynomial $f\in k[X_1,\dotsc,X_m]$ of degree $0<d<\sqrt[n]{m}$ has a non-trivial zero in $k^m$.
\end{defi}
\begin{rem}
	We are only interested in $C_1$ since the properties $C_n$ for $n>1$ seem to be quite useless.
\end{rem}
To finish the section, we state two classical results on $C_1$ fields without proofs.
\begin{prop}
	Let $K$ be a field having property $C_1$.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item Every algebraic extension of $K$ is $C_1$ again.
		\item For all Galois extensions $L/K$ and all $p>0$ we have $H^p(\Gal(L/K),L^{\times})=0$.
		\item More generally, the absolute Galois group $G=\Gal(K^\sep/K)$ has cohomological dimension $\leq 1$. That is, for any discrete continuous $G$-module $T$ and all $p>1$ we have $H^p(G,T)=0$.
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{prop}[Tsen]
	If $K$ is of transcendence degree $1$ over a separably closed field, then $K$ is $C_1$.
\end{prop}
\section{The Relation between \texorpdfstring{$H^1$}{H1} and Torsors}\label{sec:torsors}
\lecture[Unsuccessful attempts on switching off a beamer. Torsors on sites. The \v Cech complex.]{2020-01-10}
\begin{defi}\label{def:torsor}
	Let $\Cc$ be a site and $\Gg$ a sheaf of groups on $\Cc$. A \defemph{$\Gg$-torsor} is a sheaf of sets $\Tt$ together with a morphism $\alpha\colon \Gg\times \Tt\morphism \Tt$ of sheaves of sets satisfying the usual axioms for a left $\Gg$-action as well as the following conditions:
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item For every object $x$ of $\Cc$, the class $\left\{y\morphism x\st \Tt(x)\neq \emptyset\right\}$ is a covering sieve of $x$.
		\item With $p_2$ denoting the projection to the second factor, the morphism
		\begin{equation*}
			(\alpha,\id_\Tt\circ p_2)\colon \Gg\times \Tt\morphism \Tt\times\Tt
		\end{equation*}
		is an isomorphism.
	\end{alphanumerate}
	A \defemph{morphism of $\Gg$-torsors} is a morphism $\tau\colon \Tt\morphism \Tt'$ of sheaves of sets compatible with the $\Gg$-action, i.e., such that the diagram
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\Gg\times \Tt\dar["\alpha"'] \rar["{(\id_\Gg,\tau)}"] &[1em] \Gg\times \Tt\dar["\smash{\alpha'}\vphantom{\alpha}"]\\
			\Tt\rar["\tau"] &[1em] \Tt'
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	commutes. A torsor is called \defemph{trivial} if $\limit_{x\in \Cc}\Tt(x)\neq \emptyset$, or equivalently, if there is an isomorphism $\Gg\isomorphism \Tt$ of $\Gg$-torsors.
\end{defi}
\begin{rem}
	The equivalence at the end of \cref{def:torsor} can be seen as follows: it's clear that $\Gg$ and thus every torsor isomorphic to it are trivial. Conversely, if we find compatible elements $t_x\in \Tt(x)$ defining an element of $\limit_{\Cc}\Tt$, then we have an isomorphism $\Gg\isomorphism \Tt$ sending $g\in \Gg(x)$ to $gt_x$ (this is abuse of notation for $\alpha(g,t_x)$, of course). This is an isomorphism, because an inverse is given by sending $t\in \Tt(x)$ to the unique section $g\in \Gg(x)$ satisfying $t=gt_x$.
\end{rem}
\begin{lem}\label{lem:easyTorsorStuff}
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item The category of $\Gg$-torsors on $\Cc$ is a groupoid.
		\item Let $\Ii$ be an injective object of the category of $\cat{Ab}(\Cc)$ of sheaves of abelian groups on $\Cc$, then every $\Ii$-torsor is trivial.
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
	Part \itememph{a}. Let $\tau\colon \Tt\morphism \Tt'$ be an arbitrary morphism of torsors. We need to show that $\Tt(x)\morphism \Tt'(x)$ is an isomorphism. First suppose $\Tt(x)$, and choose an element $t\in \Tt(x)$. By $\Gg$-equivariance, $\Tt(x)\morphism \Tt'(x)$ is given by $\tau(gt)=g\tau(t)$, hence an isomorphism since the $\Gg(x)$-action is simply transitive on both sides. In general, $x$ can be covered by objects $y\in \Cc$ such that $\Tt(y)\neq \emptyset$, and the sheaf axiom shows that $\Tt(x)\morphism \Tt'(x)$ is an isomorphism in the general case as well.
	
	Part \itememph{b}. Since $\Ii$ is abelian, we will use additive notation. Define the \enquote{internal $\Hom$} presheaf $\Jj\coloneqq \Hhom_\Cc(\Tt,\Ii)$ on $\Cc$ by $\Jj(x)=\Hom_{\cat{PSh}(\Cc/x)}(\Tt,\Ii)$. It's easy to check that $\Jj$ is in fact a sheaf of abelian groups, the group structure given by addition on $\Ii$. Moreover, there is a canonical morphism $\iota\colon \Ii\morphism \Jj$ given by sending a section $i\in \Ii(x)$ to the constant $i$-valued morphism in $\Jj(x)=\Hom_{\cat{PSh}(\Cc/x)}(\Tt,\Ii)$, i.e., the morphism sending any $t\in \Tt(y)$ to the image of $i$ in $\Ii(y)$. This $\iota$ is clearly a monomorphism. Thus, since $\Ii$ is injective, it must have a split $\pi\colon \Jj\morphism \Ii$.
	
	We also have a morphism $\kappa\colon \Tt\morphism \Jj$ sending $t\in \Tt(x)$ to $(-)-t\in \Hom_{\cat{PSh}(\Cc/x)}(\Tt,\Ii)$. Here the morphism of sheaves $(-)-t$ sends any $t'\in \Tt(y)$ to the unique $i\in \Ii(y)$ such that $t'-i$ equals the image of $t$ in $\Tt(y)$. Now its easy to see that
	\begin{equation*}
		\Tt\morphism[\kappa]\Jj\morphism[\pi]\Ii
	\end{equation*}
	is not only a morphism of sheaves, but also a morphism of $\Ii$-torsors. Hence $\Tt\cong \Ii$ by part~\itememph{a}.
\end{proof}
\begin{defi}\label{def:i-splitting}
	Let $i\colon \Gg\morphism\Hh$ be a morphism of sheaves of groups on $\Cc$ and $\Tt$ a $\Gg$-torsor. An \defemph{$i$-splitting} of $\Tt$ is a morphism $\sigma\colon \Tt\morphism \Hh$ such that $\sigma(gt)=i(g)\sigma(t)$ for all $g\in \Gg(x)$, $t\in \Tt(x)$.
\end{defi}
\begin{rem}\label{rem:i_*T}
	An $i$-splitting of $\Tt$ as defined in \cref{def:i-splitting} is obviously equivalent to giving a trivialization of the $\Hh$-torsor $i_*\Tt\coloneqq(\Tt\times \Hh)/\Gg$. However, Professor Franke does not intend to define pushforwards of torsors in general.
\end{rem}
\numpar{}From now on, all sheaves of groups will be abelian and we will use additive notation for convenience (except for the sheaf $\Oo_{X_\et}^\times$ considered in \cref{fact:H1Pic} below). Consider a short exact sequence
\begin{equation*}
	0\morphism \Gg\morphism[i]\Hh\morphism[\pi]\Qq\morphism 0
\end{equation*}
in $\cat{Ab}(\Cc)$ and let $(\Tt,\sigma)$ be a $\Gg$-torsor equipped with an $i$-splitting $\sigma$. If $\Tt(x)\neq \emptyset$, then $q_x\coloneqq \pi(\sigma(t))$ does not depend on the choice of $t\in \Tt(x)$, as
\begin{equation*}
	\pi\big(\sigma(g+t)\big)=\pi\big(i(g)+\sigma(t)\big)=0+\pi\big(\sigma(t)\big)\,.
\end{equation*}
If $x$ is arbitrary, then the sheaf axiom provides us with a unique element $q_x\in \Qq(x)$ such that $v^*q_x=q_y$ whenever $v\colon y\morphism x$ is an $x$-object satisfying $\Tt(y)\neq \emptyset$. By compatibility, the $q_x$ define an element $q\in \limit_{\Cc}\Qq$.

It is easy to see that this $q$ only depends on the isomorphism class of $(\Tt,\sigma)$; we denote it by $q(\Tt,\sigma)$ from now on. Moreover, if $h\in \limit_{\Cc}\Hh$ and $h+\sigma\colon \Tt\morphism \Hh$ is defined in the obvious way as $(h+\sigma)(t)\coloneqq h+\sigma(t)$, then $q(\Tt,h+\sigma)=\pi(h)+q(\Tt,\sigma)$.

Conversely, suppose $q\in \limit_\Cc\Qq$ is given. We put $\Tt_q(x)\coloneqq \left\{h\in\Hh(x)\st \pi(h)=q\right\}$ and let $\sigma_q\colon \Tt_q\morphism \Hh$ be the obvious embedding. Then $\Tt_q$ is a $\Gg$-torsor and $\sigma_q$ an $i$-splitting. One easily checks $q(\Tt_q,\sigma_q)=q$ and that $\sigma\colon \Tt\morphism \Hh$ restricts to an isomorphism $\Tt\isomorphism \Tt_{q(\Tt,\sigma)}$. Thus we obtain: 
\begin{lem}
	The association $(\Tt,\sigma)\mapsto q(\Tt,\sigma)$ defines a bijection
	\begin{equation*}
		\left\{\Gg\text{-torsors with an $i$-splitting}\right\}\isomorphism \limit_\Cc\Qq\,,
	\end{equation*}
	compatible with the action of $\limit_\Cc\Hh$ on both sides.
\end{lem}
\begin{rem}\label{rem:iSplittingsExist}
	If $\Hh=\Ii$ is injective, then $i$-splittings always exist as $i_*\Tt$ from \cref{rem:i_*T} is trivial by \cref{lem:easyTorsorStuff}\itememph{b}. Since we didn't and won't define pushforward of torsors, Professor Franke suggest alternatively to copy the proof of said result \emph{mutatis mutandis}.
\end{rem}
\begin{prop}\label{prop:TorsorsH1}
	Let $\Cc$ be a site. We denote by $H^i(-)$ the $i\ordinalth$ right-derived functor of $\Global(-)\colon \cat{Ab}(\Cc)\morphism \cat{Ab}$ defined by $\Global(\Gg)=\limit_\Cc\Gg$. Then for any $\Gg$ one has a bijection
	\begin{align*}
		\left\{\text{iso.\ classes of $\Ff$-torsors}\right\}&\isomorphism H^1(\Gg)\\
		\Tt&\longmapsto \big(q(T,\sigma)\bmod \pi\Global(\Ii)\big)\\
		\Tt_q&\longmapsfrom \big(q \bmod \pi\Global(\Ii)\big)\,.
	\end{align*}
	Here we have chosen an arbitrary resolution $0\morphism \Gg\morphism[i]\Ii\morphism[\pi]\Qq\morphism 0$ with $\Ii$ injective, so that $H^1(\Ff)\cong \Global(\Qq)/\Global(\Ii)$, and $\sigma$ is any $\Ii$-splitting (which exists by \cref{rem:iSplittingsExist}).
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}[Sketch of a proof]
	This follows from the above and a few calculations. Also note that $\cat{Ab}(\Cc)$ has enough injectives: this follows from \cite[Théorème~1.10.1]{tohoku}, but we are only going to use \cref{prop:TorsorsH1} in cases where we already know the existence of sufficiently many injectives. 
\end{proof}
\begin{rem*}\label{rem*:groupStructureOnTorsors}
	The identification with $H^1(\Gg)$ suggests that there should be a canonical group structure on the set of isomorphism classes of $\Gg$-torsors. It can be explicitly described as follows: for torsors $\Tt$ and $\Tt'$, consider the sheaf
	\begin{equation*}
		\Tt\times_\Gg\Tt\coloneqq (\Tt\times \Tt')/\Gg\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Here \enquote{modding out $\Gg$} is abuse of notation for modding out the equivalence relation given by $(g+t,t')\sim (t,g+t')$ for all $g\in \Gg(x)$, $t\in \Tt(x)$, $t'\in \Tt'(x)$. Then $\Tt\times_\Gg\Tt'$ becomes a $\Gg$-torsor again in a canonical way.
	
	We claim that $-\times_\Gg-$ corresponds to the addition in the group $H^1(\Gg)$. By \cref{prop:TorsorsH1} it suffices to show that $\Tt_0\cong \Gg$ is the neutral element (which is straightforward) and that $\Tt_{q+q'}\cong \Tt_q\times_G\Tt_{q'}$. Upon inspection, sections of $\Tt_q\times_G\Tt_{q'}$ are equivalence classes of pairs $(h,h')$ such that $\pi(h)=q$ and $\pi(h')=q'$. Then its easy to check that $[h,h']\mapsto h+h'$ is well-defined and induces the required isomorphism $\Tt_q\times_G\Tt_{q'}\isomorphism \Tt_{q+q'}$.
\end{rem*}
The main application of the theory of torsors to étale cohomology comes through $\Oo_{X_\et}^\times$-torsors, which happen to be just line bundles over $X$.
\begin{fact}\label{fact:H1Pic}
	Let $X$ be a scheme. There is an equivalence of groupoids
	\begin{equation*}
		\left\{\begin{tabular}{c}
		line bundles $\Ll$ on $X$,\\
		isomorphisms of line bundles
		\end{tabular}\right\}\isomorphism \left\{\Oo_{X_\et}^\times\text{-torsors}\right\}\,.
	\end{equation*}
\end{fact}
\begin{proof}[Sketch of a proof]
	If $\Ll$ is a line bundle on $X$, we can construct an $\Oo_{X_\et}^\times$-torsor $\Tt_\Ll$ as follows: if $j\colon U\morphism X$ is an étale $X$-scheme, we put
	\begin{equation*}
		\Global(U,\Tt_\Ll)=\big\{\lambda\in \Global(U,j^*\Ll)\ \big|\ \lambda\colon \Oo_U\isomorphism \Ll\text{ is an isomorphism}\big\}\,,
	\end{equation*}
	which has a natural $\Global(U,\Oo_{X_\et}^\times)$-action given by multiplication. This defines a functor $\Ll\mapsto \Tt_\Ll$ from the left-hand side to the right-hand side.
	
	Conversely let $\Tt$ be an $\Oo_{X_\et}^\times$-torsor. We wish to construct a corresponding line bundle $\Ll_\Tt$ via faithfully flat descent (in the form of étale descent of course). Let's first assume $\Tt$ is trivial over $X$, i.e., $\Global(X,\Tt)\neq \emptyset$. We define $\Ll_\Tt$ as a sheaf of sets first: for open subsets $U\subseteq X$, put
	\begin{equation*}
		\Global(U,\Ll_\Tt)=\left\{(t,f)\st t\in \Global(U,\Tt)\text{ and }f\in\Global(U,\Oo_X^\times)\right\}/_\sim\,,
	\end{equation*}
	where $\sim$ is the equivalence relation defined as $(t,f)\sim (t',f')$ iff there is a $\lambda\in \Global(U,\Oo_X^\times)$ such that $t'=\lambda t$ and $f'=\lambda f$. Thus, fixing $t$, every equivalence class has a unique representative of the form $(t,f)$. It's easy to check that addition and scalar multiplication on equivalence classes defined by $[t,f]+[t,f']\coloneqq [t,f+f']$ and $\lambda[t,f]\coloneqq [t,\lambda f]$ are independent of the choice of $t$ and turn $\Ll_\Tt$ into a line bundle over $\Oo_X$ (in fact, even a trivial one).
	
	For arbitrary $X$, we always find an étale cover $\{U_i\morphism X\}_{i\in I}$ such that $\Tt$ is trivial over each $U_i$. Then the above construction gives line bundles $\Ll_i$ over $U_i$ corresponding to $\Tt|_{U_i}$. It can be checked immediately that the $\Ll_i$ form a descent datum, hence define a line bundle $\Ll_\Tt$ on $X$ via faithfully flat descent. We leave it to the reader to verify that the functors $\Ll\mapsto \Tt_\Ll$ and $\Tt\mapsto \Ll_\Tt$ are indeed quasi-inverse to each other.
\end{proof}
\begin{cor}\label{cor:H1Pic}
	For any scheme $X$, we have $H^1(X_\et,\Oo_{X_\et}^\times)\cong \Pic(X)$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof*}[Sketch of a proof]
	We get from \cref{prop:TorsorsH1} and \cref{fact:H1Pic} that both sides are in canonical bijection as sets. It remains to check that this is an isomorphism of abelian groups as well. To this end, we check that for line bundles $\Ll$ and $\Ll'$ the canonical map $\Global(U,\Tt_{\Ll})\times \Global(U,\Tt_{\Ll'})\morphism \Global(U,\Tt_{\Ll\otimes\Ll'})$ sending $(\lambda,\lambda')$ to $\lambda\otimes \lambda'$ induces an isomorphism
	\begin{equation*}
		\Tt_{\Ll}\times_{\Oo_{X_\et}}\Tt_{\Ll'}\isomorphism \Tt_{\Ll\otimes \Ll'}\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Then \cref{rem*:groupStructureOnTorsors} shows that the group structures on both sides coincide.
\end{proof*}
\begin{cor}[Hilbert's theorem~90]\label{cor:Hilbert90}
	If $k$ is any field, then
	\begin{equation*}
		H^1\big(\Gal (k^\sep/k),k^{\sep,\times}\big)=0\,.
	\end{equation*}
\end{cor}
\begin{proof*}
	Let $X=\Spec k$ and $\ov{x}\colon \Spec k^\sep\morphism X$. Then $k^{\sep,\times}\cong \Oo_{X_\et,\ov{x}}^\times$. Hence \cref{prop:etaleGalois}\itememph{c} and \cref{cor:H1Pic} show
	\begin{equation*}
		H^1\big(\Gal (k^\sep/k),k^{\sep,\times}\big)\cong H^1\big(X_\et,\Oo_{X_\et}^\times\big)\cong \Pic(X)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	But the right-hand side is trivial because $X$ is just a point.
\end{proof*}
\section{Applications of \texorpdfstring{\v C}{C}ech Cohomology}
\begin{con}
	Let $\Cc$ be an arbitary category admitting fibre products and let $\Ff\in \cat{PAb}(\Cc)$ be a presheaf of abelian groups. For any morphism $u\morphism x$ in $\Cc$ put
	\begin{equation*}
		\check{C}^n\big(\{u\rightarrow x\},\Ff\big)=\Ff(\underbrace{u\times_x\dotsb\times_x u}_{n+1\text{ factors}})\,.
	\end{equation*}
	For $0\leq j\leq n+1$ let $d_j\colon \check{C}^n(\{u\morphism x\},\Ff)\morphism\check{C}^{n+1}(\{u\morphism x\},\Ff)$ be the morphism induced by the projection
	\begin{equation*}
		\underbrace{u\times_x\dotsb\times_xu}_{n+2\text{ factors}}\morphism \underbrace{u\times_x\dotsb\times_xu}_{n+1\text{ factors}}
	\end{equation*}
	omitting the $j\ordinalth$ factor (the numbering of factors starts at $0$). This gives a cochain complex
	\begin{equation*}

	\end{equation*}
	with differential $d=\sum_{j=0}^{n+1}(-1)^jd_j$ in degree $n$, called the \defemph{\v Cech complex} of $\{u\morphism x\}$ with coefficients in $\Ff$. It's cohomology
	\begin{equation*}
		\check{H}^i\big(\{u\rightarrow x\},\Ff\big)\coloneqq H^i\check{C}^\bullet\big(\{u\rightarrow x\},\Ff\big)
	\end{equation*}
	is called the \defemph{\v Cech cohomology} of $\Ff$.
