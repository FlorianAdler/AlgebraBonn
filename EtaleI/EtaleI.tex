Bonn by Professor Jens Franke in the winter term (Wintersemester) 2019/20.

Some changes and some additions have been made by the author. To distinguish them from the lecture's actual contents, they are labelled with an asterisk.

\chapter{Preface}
\numpar*{Organizational stuff}As a result of a democratic decision in the preliminary meeting, the lecture will take place on Mondays from from 18:00 to 20:00 and on Fridays from 16:00 to 18:00, in the \enquote{Großer Hörsaal}.

Recommended prerequisites to this lecture are
\begin{temize}
	\item flat morphisms and faithfully flat descent,
	\item abelian varieties, in particular, the Jacobian of a curve.
\end{temize}
Nevertheless, Professor Franke promised to give a quick reminder on flat and étale morphisms in the first lecture. Moreover, typed lecture notes are available for Professor Franke's lecture on Jacobians of curves held in the winter term 2018/19 (see \cite{jacobians}). 

The goal of this lecture is to study the \emph{$\ell$-adic cohomology} of a scheme $X$, where $\ell\neq p$ is a prime different from the characteristic $p$ of $X$. These groups will be constructed as
\begin{align*}
	H_\et^i(X,\IZ_\ell)\coloneqq\limit_{n\geq 1}H^i(X_\et,\IZ/\ell^n\IZ)\,.
\end{align*}
Along the way, we will come across sheaves on the étale site, the relation between étale and Galois cohomology, cohomology of curves, and proper base change.

\numpar*{Author's note}
In these notes, the modern meaning of the word \emph{scheme} is used. That is, a scheme in these lecture notes is what Professor Franke would call a \emph{prescheme}, and what he would call a \emph{scheme} will be called a \emph{separated scheme} in here.

Also I will not follow Franke's numbering scheme\footnote{\ldots\ if not to say, numbering \emph{prescheme}.}, as I believe this document is easier to navigate if propositions/lemmas/etc.\ are numbered consecutively rather than independent of each other. 

\numpar*{\Attention\ Important note}\textbf{I won't be in Bonn on the 20th and 23rd Decembre, so I'm going to miss the last two Étale lectures in 2019!}
This means \textbf{no lecture notes} \dotso unless \emph{you} help me out! I would very much appreciate if one of you could share their notes with me. You can just send a photo to my e-mail address \href{mailto:ferdinand.wagner@uni-bonn.de}{\texttt{ferdinand.wagner@uni-bonn.de}}. Of course you can also send me \TeX\ code or even a pull request (well, less work for me), but I'm perfectly happy with \sout{any handwritten notes} readable handwritten notes. Merry Christmas!

\chapter{Cohomology}
\section{Definitions and Basic Facts}
\lecture[]{2019-12-16}Étale cohomology of schemes and morphisms between them will be constructed using the machinery of \defemph{right-derived functors}. We assume familiarity with the construction of the functors $R^iF$ for any left-exact functor $F$ between abelian categories. Since the $R^iF$ are usually computed via injective resolutions (provided such resolutions exist), it is useful to have the following proposition.
\begin{prop}\label{prop:enoughInjectives}
	Let $X$ be an arbitrary scheme.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item The category $\cat{Ab}(X_\et)$ of sheaves of abelian groups on $X_\et$ has sufficiently many injectives.
		\item If $j\colon U\morphism X$ is étale and $\Ii\in\cat{Ab}(X_\et)$ is injective, then $j^*\Ii\in\cat{Ab}(U_\et)$ is injective too.
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	The general way to do this is to use Grothendieck's [TODO], but for this lecture Professor Franke prefers a down-to-the-earth approach.
	
	We begin with \itememph{a}. For a geometric point $x$ of $X$, the functor $x_*\colon \cat{Ab}\morphism \cat{Ab}(X_\et)$ of forming a \enquote{skyscraper sheaf} has the exact left-adjoint $(-)_x\colon \cat{Ab}(X_\et)\morphism\cat{Ab}$ of forming the stalk at $x$. Thus $x_*$ preserves injective objects, i.e., if $I$ is an injective abelian group, then $x_*I$ is injective in $\cat{Ab}(X_\et)$. Also recall $(x_*I)\cong I$. Now let $\Ff$ be an arbitrary abelian sheaf on $X_\et$. For every geometric point $x$ choose an embedding $\Ff_x\monomorphism I_x$ into an injective abelian group, using that $\cat{Ab}$ has enough injectives. By the stalk-skyscraper adjunction, we get a morphism $\Ff\morphism x_*I_x$. Now consider
	\begin{equation*}
		\Ff\morphism\prod_{x}x_*I_x\,,
	\end{equation*}
	where the product is taken over \enquote{all} (in the sense if \cref{rem:setTheory}) geometric points of $X$. The product on the right-hand side is a product of injective objects, hence injective itself. It remains to show that the morphism is injective. So let $\Kk$ be its kernel. Composing with the projection to the $x\ordinalth$ factor, we see that $\Kk$ lies in the kernel of $\Ff\morphism x_*I_x$. This kernel, however, vanishes at $x$, hence $\Kk_x=0$ for all chosen $x$, proving that $\Kk=0$.
	
	For \itememph{b}, there are two approaches, which are both important on their own. One can use the fact that $j^*x_*I\cong \bigoplus_uu_*I$, where the sum is taken over the preimages (in the sense of \cref{rem:WTFlyingOver}\itememph{1}) of $x$ in $U$. In particular, this is a finite direct sum as $j$ is quasi-finite, so the right-hand side stays injective if $I$ is an injective abelian group. Then one may apply \cref{lem:injectiveStuff} below, using $\XX=\left\{\Ii\in\cat{Ab}(X_\et)\st j^*\Ii\text{ is injective in }\cat{Ab}(U_\et)\right\}$. Another proof uses \cref{prop:j!} and the fact that every functor having an exact left-adjoint preserves injectivity.
\end{proof}
\begin{lem}\label{lem:injectiveStuff}
	Let $\Aa$ be an abelian category and $\XX$ a class of objects of $\Aa$ such that the following two conditions are satisfied.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item If $x\in\XX$ and $y\morphism x$ is a split monomorphism, then also $y\in \XX$.
		\item For every object $a\in\Aa$ there is a monomorphism $a\monomorphism x$ with $x\in \XX$.
	\end{alphanumerate}
	Then $\XX$ contains all injective objects of $\Aa$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
	If $i$ is injective, then the monomorphism $i\morphism x$ from \itememph{b} splits, hence $i\in\XX$ by \itememph{a}.
\end{proof}
\begin{prop}\label{prop:j!}
	If $j\colon U\morphism X$ is étale, then $j^*\colon \cat{Ab}(X_\et)\morphism\cat{Ab}(U_\et)$ has an exact left-adjoint
	\begin{equation*}
		j_!\colon \cat{Ab}(U_\et)\morphism\cat{Ab}(X_\et)\,.
	\end{equation*}
	Concretely, if $x$ is a geometric point of $X$ and $\Ff\in\cat{Ab}(U_\et)$, then $(j_!\Ff)_x\cong \bigoplus_u\Ff_u$, the sum being taken over all preimages of $x$ in $U$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}[Sketch of a proof]
	We first construct a functor $j_\sharp$ between the presheaf categories, which is left-adjoint to $j^\sharp$ from \cref{con:f^*}. If $V\morphism X$ is étale, we put
	\begin{equation*}
		\Global(V,j_\sharp \Ff)=\bigoplus_{\phi\colon V\morphism U}\Global(V,\Ff)\,,
	\end{equation*}
	where the sum is taken over all factorizations $\phi\colon V\morphism U$ of $V\morphism X$ over $j$. The left-adjointness to $j^\sharp$ (which is a straightforward restriction functor in our case) as well as the formula for the stalks are verified by an easy calculation. Now define $j_!\Ff=(j_\sharp\Ff)^\Sh$. If follows that $j_!$ is indeed a left-adjoint of $j^*$. Exactness can be seen from the calculation of stalks.
\end{proof}
\begin{rem}
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item The formula for stalks in \cref{prop:j!} is left-adjoint to $j^*x_*I\cong \bigoplus_uu_*I$, which was used earlier in the proof of \cref{prop:enoughInjectives}.
		\item In the case of an open immersion $j\colon U\monomorphism X$, the formula for stalks shows that $j_!\Ff$ is the usual \enquote{extension by zero}.
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{rem}
\begin{defi}[\textsc{Finally!}]
	Let $X$ be an arbitraty scheme.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item We denote by $H^i(X_\et,-)$ the $i\ordinalth$ right-derived functor of the global sections functor $\Global(X,-)\colon \cat{Ab}(X_\et)\morphism\cat{Ab}$.
		\item For a morphism $f\colon X\morphism Y$ of schemes, let $R^if_*$ denote the $i\ordinalth$ right-derived functor of $f_*\colon \cat{Ab}(X_\et)\morphism\cat{Ab}(Y_\et)$.
		\item Let $\zeta_{X,*}\colon \cat{Ab}(X_\et)\morphism\cat{Ab}(X_\Zar)$ denote the restriction to the Zariski site, i.e., for $\Ff\in\cat{Ab}(X_\et)$, the sheaf $\zeta_{X,*}\Ff$ is obtained by restricting $\Ff$ to Zariski opens of $X$. We let $R^i\zeta_{X,*}$ denote its right-derived functors.
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{defi}
\begin{rem}
	By \cref{prop:enoughInjectives}\itememph{b}, the functors $H^i(U_\et,j^*(-))\colon \cat{Ab}(X_\et)\morphism \cat{Ab}$ are the derived functors $\Global(U,-)\colon \cat{Ab}(X_\et)\morphism\cat{Ab}$ taking sections over $U$.
\end{rem}
\begin{rem}
	If $\Rr$ is a sheaf of rings on $X_\et$, then $H^i(X_\et,-)$ are also the (underlying abelian groups of the) derived functors of $\Global(X,-)\colon \cat{Mod}_\Rr\morphism \cat{Mod}_{\Global(X,\Rr)}$. [TODO: Why?]
\end{rem}
\begin{rem}
	For $\Ff\in\cat{Ab}(X_\et)$, the sheaf $R^if_*\Ff$ is the sheafification of the presheaf $V\mapsto H^i((X\times_YV)_\et,\Ff)$ for $V\morphism Y$ étale. Here $\Ff$ should actually be replaced by the pullback of $\Ff$ to $X\times_VY$, but such abuse of notation is very convenient and we will use it often.
	
	To see why the assertion is true, let $\Phi^i$ denote the functors described above. Then the sequence $(\Phi^i)_{i\geq 0}$ forms a cohomological functor (i.e., takes short exact sequences to a long exact sequence), $\Phi^0$ agrees with $R^0f_*$, and $\Phi^i$ kills injective objects of $\cat{Ab}(X_\et)$ for all $i>0$ by \cref{prop:enoughInjectives}\itememph{b}. It is a well-known fact that in such a situation the $\Phi^i$ are indeed the derived functors of $f_*$. For some reason, we write down this fact in \cref{prop:effacable} below.
\end{rem}
\begin{prop}\label{prop:effacable}
	Let $\Aa$ and $\Bb$ be abelian categories.
	\begin{alphanumerate}
		\item Let $(\Phi^i)_{i\geq 0}\colon \Aa\morphism\Bb$ be a cohomological functor. Then the $\Phi^i$ are the derived functors of $F=\Phi^0$ if one of the following \enquote{effacability conditions} holds:
		\begin{numerate}
			\item If $\Bb=\cat{Mod}_R$ is the category of modules over a ring, then it is sufficient that for every $i>0$, all $a\in\Aa$, and all $f\in \Phi^i(a)$, there is a monomorphism $j\colon a\monomorphism b$ in $\Aa$ such that $\Phi^i(j)(f)=0$.
			\item If $\Bb=\cat{Mod}_\Rr$ is the category of modules over a sheaf of rings on a topological space $X$ or on $X_\et$, then it suffices that for every (geometric) point $x$ of $X$, all $i>0$, every $a\in \Aa$, and every $f\in \Phi^i(a)_x$, there is a monomorphism $j\colon a\monomorphism b$ in $\Aa$ such that $\Phi^i(j)(f)=0$.
			\item If $\Bb$ is arbitrary, we need that for every $i>0$ and all $a\in\Aa$ there is a monomorphism $j\colon a\monomorphism b$ such that $\Phi^i(j)=0$.
			\item If $\Bb$ is arbitrary and $\Aa$ has enough injectives, it suffices to have $\Phi^i(a)=0$ whenever $a\in \Aa$ is injective.
		\end{numerate}
		\item Assume $\Aa$ has sufficiently many injectives. Let $F\colon \Aa\morphism \Bb$ be a left-exact functor and $\XX\subseteq \Aa$ a class of objects satisfying the conditions from \cref{lem:injectiveStuff} and in addition
		\begin{alphanumerate}
			\item[\itememph{*}] If $0\morphism x'\morphism x\morphism x''\morphism 0$ is exact in $\Aa$ and $x',x\in \XX$, then also $x''\in \XX$ and $Fx\morphism Fx'$ is an epimorphism.
		\end{alphanumerate}
		Then every injective object of $\Aa$ is in $\XX$ and $R^iF(x)=0$ for $x\in \XX$.
	\end{alphanumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{prop}
	If $f\colon X\morphism Y$ and $g\colon Y\morphism Z$ are morphisms of schemes, then we have four Leray spectral sequences
	\begin{align*}
		E_2^{p,q}=H^p(Y_\et,R^qf_*\Ff)&\converge H^{p+q}(X_\et,\Ff)\\ E_2^{p,q}=H^p(X_\Zar,R^q\zeta_{X,*}\Ff)&\converge H^{p+q}(X_\et,\Ff)\\
		E_2^{p,q}=R^pg_*R^qf_*\Ff&\converge R^{p+q}(gf)_*\Ff\\
		E_2^{p,q}=R^pf_{\Zar,*}R^q\zeta_{X,*}\Ff&\converge \zeta_{Y,*}R^{p+q}f_*\Ff
	\end{align*}
\end{prop}
